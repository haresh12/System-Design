/**
 *   **DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTING (IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION)**
 * 
 *   1. **What is Unit Testing?**
 *      - Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a program 
 *        are tested in isolation. The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as 
 *        expected. In most cases, unit tests focus on functions, methods, or classes. Popular frameworks 
 *        like Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine are used for JavaScript unit testing. This is crucial for catching 
 *        bugs early in the development process and ensuring code reliability.
 * 
 *   2. **What is Integration Testing?**
 *      - Integration testing is the process of testing how different modules or units work together 
 *        as a group. It validates the interaction between software components that may depend on each other. 
 *        This type of testing is important because even if individual units function correctly, bugs can 
 *        arise when they are integrated. Testing libraries like Mocha or Jest in combination with frameworks 
 *        such as React Testing Library are often used.
 * 
 *   3. **What is Component Testing?**
 *      - Component testing focuses on verifying the functionality of an individual component in isolation, 
 *        particularly in component-based frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. In this type of testing, 
 *        the visual and interactive aspects of UI components are tested to ensure they render properly and 
 *        handle interactions as expected. Libraries like Enzyme, React Testing Library, and Vue Test Utils 
 *        are commonly used for component testing.
 * 
 *   4. **What is A/B Testing?**
 *      - A/B testing is a user-experience research methodology that involves showing two variants (A and B) 
 *        to users and analyzing which version performs better in terms of engagement or conversions. This 
 *        type of testing is popular in web development for optimizing UI, content, and user interaction. 
 *        Tools like Google Optimize, Optimizely, and VWO (Visual Website Optimizer) are commonly used for A/B 
 *        testing. It's widely used in marketing and UI/UX design to improve overall site performance.
 * 
 *   5. **What is Performance Testing?**
 *      - Performance testing is used to evaluate the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a system 
 *        under a particular workload. This type of testing identifies performance bottlenecks, ensuring 
 *        applications run smoothly under stress conditions. Tools like Apache JMeter, WebPageTest, and 
 *        Google Lighthouse help simulate various scenarios and collect data on time-to-interactive, 
 *        page load times, and overall system performance. This is critical to maintain a good user 
 *        experience and application efficiency.
 * 
 *   6. **What is TDD (Test-Driven Development)?**
 *      - Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written 
 *        before the code itself. In TDD, developers first create a failing test that defines a desired 
 *        function or improvement, then write code to pass that test, and finally refactor the code while 
 *        ensuring all tests still pass. TDD promotes clean, bug-resistant code and ensures that 
 *        developers only write code that's needed to pass the tests. Popular testing libraries for TDD 
 *        include Jest, Mocha, and JUnit (for Java).
 * 
 *   7. **What is E2E Testing? Best Tools for It (Puppeteer or Alternatives)?**
 *      - End-to-End (E2E) testing is a methodology that ensures the entire flow of an application works 
 *        as expected, from the user interface to the backend and databases. E2E testing simulates 
 *        real-world user scenarios to ensure the system works as a whole. Puppeteer, Cypress, and Playwright 
 *        are popular tools for E2E testing in modern web applications. Puppeteer works with headless browsers, 
 *        allowing you to automate interactions like clicks, form submissions, and more. Cypress is often 
 *        preferred due to its speed and developer-friendly features.
 * 
 *   8. **What is Security Testing?**
 *      - Security testing ensures that an application is free of vulnerabilities that could be exploited 
 *        by attackers. This includes testing for issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), 
 *        and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Security testing identifies weaknesses that could compromise 
 *        sensitive data, ensuring that an application adheres to security standards. Tools like OWASP ZAP, 
 *        Burp Suite, and Nessus are used to find and resolve these vulnerabilities. Security is a critical 
 *        concern in all web applications, especially those handling sensitive data.
 * 
 *   9. **Explain How Burp Suite is Helpful in Security Testing?**
 *      - Burp Suite is an integrated security testing tool that allows testers to identify vulnerabilities 
 *        within web applications. It provides a wide range of features like proxy interception, crawling, 
 *        scanning, and reporting to test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injections and XSS. Burp Suite 
 *        enables security testers to map out the structure of a web app, analyze requests/responses, and 
 *        manipulate them to uncover hidden security risks. Its ability to automate security testing while 
 *        offering manual control makes it a popular tool in penetration testing.
 * 
 *   10. **Explain Performance Tab, Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest?**
 *       - These are essential tools used for performance testing:
 *       - **Performance Tab (Chrome DevTools):** Helps developers monitor the real-time performance of their 
 *         web pages, providing insights on rendering, scripting, painting, and memory usage.
 *       - **Lighthouse:** An open-source tool integrated into Chrome DevTools that audits web performance, 
 *         accessibility, SEO, and PWA capabilities, providing a score and suggestions for improvements.
 *       - **PageSpeed Insights:** A tool by Google that evaluates web performance for both mobile and desktop, 
 *         generating reports on metrics like TTFB (Time to First Byte) and Speed Index.
 *       - **WebPageTest:** Provides in-depth testing for website performance across different browsers, 
 *         offering waterfall charts, first contentful paint, and time-to-interactive metrics.
 *       - Together, these tools help developers diagnose performance issues and optimize their applications 
 *         for faster load times and better user experiences.
