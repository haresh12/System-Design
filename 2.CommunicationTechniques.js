 *      
 *                          SHORT POLLING
 * 
 * 
 * WHAT IS SHORT POLLING ?
 * 
 * Short polling is a technique where the client sends 
 * HTTP requests to the server at regular intervals 
 * (e.g., every few seconds) to check for new data or updates. 
 * The server responds with the current state, even if there 
 * are no new updates. 
 * 
 * Unlike long polling or WebSockets, short polling is simpler 
 * but can be less efficient as it generates multiple requests 
 * which increase network overhead.
 * 
 * 
 * SCENARIO WHERE SHORT POLLING IS USEFUL ?
 * 
 * Short polling is useful when:
 * 
 * 1. Real-time communication is not critical but periodic 
 *    updates are required.
 *    - Example: A news feed or chat app where updates don’t 
 *      need to be instantaneous.
 * 
 * 2. The client cannot support advanced techniques like 
 *    WebSockets or long polling due to technical constraints.
 * 
 * 3. Server-side events are unpredictable, making it inefficient 
 *    to hold open connections for long periods.
 * 
 * 
 * WHAT CHANGES DO WE NEED IN BACKEND AND FRONTEND ?
 * 
 * Backend:
 * 
 * 1. The server should be capable of responding to frequent 
 *    requests without performance issues (e.g., caching results).
 * 
 * 2. Server must return immediate responses even when 
 *    no new data is available.
 * 
 * Frontend:
 * 
 * 1. Use `setInterval()` or similar mechanisms to send 
 *    requests at regular intervals.
 * 
 * 2. Efficiently handle the server response and update the 
 *    UI if new data is available.
 * 
 * 
 * BEST JAVASCRIPT EXAMPLE ?
 * 
 * // Short polling using setInterval in JavaScript
 * 
 * function shortPoll() {
 *   setInterval(async () => {
 *     try {
 *       const response = await fetch('/api/check-updates');
 *       const data = await response.json();
 *       if (data.newUpdates) {
 *         updateUI(data);
 *       }
 *     } catch (error) {
 *       console.error('Polling error:', error);
 *     }
 *   }, 5000);  // Poll every 5 seconds
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * MORE ADVANCED TOPICS TO CONSIDER:
 * 
 * 1. **Polling Efficiency**: 
 *    - **What is it?**
 *      Polling efficiency refers to optimizing the frequency and 
 *      logic of polling to reduce unnecessary requests and server 
 *      load. For instance, you can implement **exponential backoff**, 
 *      where the interval between polling requests increases 
 *      progressively if no updates are available.
 *    - **How to implement?**
 *      Start with a short interval (e.g., 5 seconds). If no updates 
 *      are received, double the interval (e.g., 10, 20, 40 seconds) 
 *      until a maximum limit is reached.
 * 
 * 2. **Error Handling**: 
 *    - **What is it?**
 *      Ensuring that short polling gracefully handles errors such as 
 *      network failures, server downtimes, or request timeouts.
 *    - **How to implement?**
 *      Use a retry mechanism in case of failure. You can use techniques 
 *      like **retry with exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming 
 *      the server. 
 *      Example:
 *      ```javascript
 *      function shortPollWithRetry() {
 *        let retryCount = 0;
 *        const maxRetries = 5;
 *        async function poll() {
 *          try {
 *            const response = await fetch('/api/check-updates');
 *            const data = await response.json();
 *            if (data.newUpdates) {
 *              updateUI(data);
 *              retryCount = 0;  // Reset on success
 *            }
 *          } catch (error) {
 *            retryCount++;
 *            if (retryCount < maxRetries) {
 *              setTimeout(poll, Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000);  // Exponential backoff
 *            } else {
 *              console.error('Max retries reached');
 *            }
 *          }
 *        }
 *        poll();
 *      }
 *      ```
 * 
 * 3. **Polling vs Push (WebSockets)**:
 *    - **What is it?**
 *      Understanding when to use polling vs real-time data push 
 *      technologies like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE). 
 *      Short polling might not be ideal for high-frequency real-time 
 *      communication.
 *    - **How to implement?**
 *      For real-time apps (e.g., stock market tickers or live messaging), 
 *      WebSockets are preferable because they maintain an open connection 
 *      and push data as soon as new information is available, avoiding the 
 *      need for repeated requests.
 * 
 * 4. **Throttling and Rate Limiting**:
 *    - **What is it?**
 *      Servers often implement rate-limiting to prevent overloading from 
 *      frequent requests (DDoS protection). Clients should handle this 
 *      gracefully by not exceeding request limits.
 *    - **How to implement?**
 *      Add logic in your client to respect rate limits provided by the 
 *      server. For example, if the server response includes headers like 
 *      `Retry-After`, your polling mechanism should respect the indicated 
 *      delay before sending the next request.

 /**
 *                                        LONG POLLING - IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION
 *
 * WHAT IS LONG POLLING?
 *
 * Long polling is a technique used to emulate real-time communication between the client and server.
 * The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server holds the request open until either:
 * 1. New data becomes available.
 * 2. A timeout occurs (typically after 30-60 seconds).
 * 
 * Once the client receives the response, it immediately sends another request to repeat the process,
 * thereby creating a continuous loop of requests and responses without the need for a permanent connection.
 *
 * HOW DOES LONG POLLING WORKS UNDER THE HOOD?
 * 
 * Here's the sequence of how long polling operates:
 *
 * 1. **Initial Request**: 
 *    The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., `GET /updates`) to the server.
 * 
 * 2. **Server Holds Connection**:
 *    - The server receives the request and doesn’t respond immediately. 
 *    - The server holds the connection open while waiting for new data (e.g., a new message in a chat, a price update).
 *    - During this time, the client is "connected" to the server via an open connection, even though no data is sent.
 *    - The server doesn’t block other tasks; it uses **asynchronous programming** to keep the connection alive without
 *      impacting other processes.
 * 
 * 3. **Response**:
 *    - If new data arrives before the timeout, the server responds to the client with the data and closes the connection.
 *    - If no new data is available, the server responds with an empty or timeout response (e.g., `HTTP 204 No Content`).
 * 
 * 4. **Client Reconnects**:
 *    Once the client receives a response, whether it's new data or a timeout, it immediately re-initiates the request 
 *    to keep polling for new updates.
 * 
 * NEED TO UNDERSTAND: HOW DOES THE REQUEST GET HELD FOR A LONG TIME?
 *
 * - **HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive**: HTTP/1.1 uses the **Keep-Alive** header, which allows the server to keep the TCP connection 
 *   alive without closing it after a response is sent.
 * 
 * - **Connection Management**: The server holds the request at the application level (using non-blocking I/O, such as Node.js' 
 *   event loop or Java's async frameworks). This way, the server can handle many open connections without using a separate 
 *   thread for each connection.
 * 
 * - **No Immediate Response**: In long polling, the server does not immediately respond to an incoming HTTP request, unless 
 *   there’s data available or a predefined timeout is reached. This "waiting" happens asynchronously, meaning the server 
 *   doesn’t block other processes.
 * 
 * **Connection Handling in HTTPS**:
 * 
 * 1. **HTTPS Handshake**: The first time a client initiates a long-polling request, there’s an SSL/TLS handshake between 
 *    the client and server. This handshake ensures that the data being transmitted is encrypted.
 * 
 * 2. **Reusing Connections**: Once the handshake is done, the HTTPS connection can be **reused** via HTTP/1.1's persistent 
 *    connection (Keep-Alive), reducing the overhead of future handshakes.
 * 
 * 3. **Request Lifecycle**: Every time the client re-initiates the request, the TLS connection is reused (if the session 
 *    hasn’t expired), minimizing the overhead of establishing a secure connection again and again. This allows the client 
 *    and server to continue the long polling with the same encrypted connection.
 * 
 * 4. **Server-Side Concurrency**: The server must handle many simultaneous long-held connections efficiently. This can be 
 *    done using:
 *    - **Event-driven systems** like Node.js (single-threaded, non-blocking) that handle thousands of open connections without 
 *      consuming many system resources.
 *    - **Thread pooling** in environments like Java to manage multiple connections.
 * 
 * CHALLENGES WHEN DEALING WITH MILLIONS OF USERS
 *
 * 1. **Handling Millions of Open Connections**:
 *    - Each client maintains an open connection with the server for long polling. Handling millions of open connections 
 *      requires a scalable architecture.
 *    - **Event-driven architectures** (like Node.js) can efficiently handle thousands of simultaneous connections with 
 *      minimal resource usage because they don’t require a dedicated thread per connection.
 *    - **Load balancing** is critical for distributing these millions of connections across multiple servers. A common 
 *      strategy is to use a reverse proxy (like NGINX) to distribute connections evenly.
 *
 * 2. **Scalability**:
 *    - Long polling isn’t as scalable as **WebSockets**. While the connection is open, resources are consumed on both the 
 *      server and client, which can be expensive.
 *    - Scaling involves horizontal scaling—spinning up more servers or containers to distribute the load.
 *    - Solutions like **Redis Pub/Sub** or message queues can be introduced to communicate between backend servers 
 *      so that clients connected to different servers can still receive updates in real-time.
 * 
 * 3. **Connection Timeouts**:
 *    - With millions of users, **timeouts** need to be managed carefully. A **timeout** should trigger a new connection 
 *      attempt by the client.
 *    - Network conditions should be considered: If users are in areas with poor internet connections, you may need to 
 *      increase timeout intervals or introduce **exponential backoff** to prevent overloading the server.
 * 
 * BACKEND CHANGES:
 *
 * 1. **Non-blocking, event-driven architecture**:
 *    - Use non-blocking servers like **Node.js** or **Nginx** with **asynchronous programming** to handle long-held requests.
 *    - This prevents the server from getting overwhelmed by thousands of open connections.
 * 
 * 2. **Efficient data retrieval**:
 *    - If your long polling is fetching data from a database, make sure the database queries are optimized and fast. Use 
 *      techniques like **caching** or **message queues** (like RabbitMQ or Redis) to prevent database overload.
 * 
 * 3. **Load Balancing**:
 *    - Use a load balancer (NGINX, AWS Load Balancer, etc.) to distribute the load of incoming requests across multiple 
 *      server instances.
 * 
 * FRONTEND CHANGES:
 *
 * 1. **Retry Logic**:
 *    - Implement retry mechanisms in case of server failure or timeouts. Use **exponential backoff** to gradually increase 
 *      the time between retries to avoid overwhelming the server.
 * 
 * 2. **Persistent Connections**:
 *    - Ensure the client can reinitiate the connection immediately after receiving a response, whether it’s a new data 
 *      response or a timeout.
 * 
 * 3. **Error Handling**:
 *    - Implement robust error handling in the client to manage network issues, server downtime, or request timeouts.
 * 
 * 4. **Optimize UI updates**:
 *    - Only update the UI when new data is received to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
 * 
 * THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN USING LONG POLLING:
 *
 * 1. **Scalability**: Long polling can lead to scalability issues as the number of concurrent users increases. Each open 
 *    connection consumes server resources, and managing thousands or millions of open connections requires careful architecture 
 *    planning.
 * 
 * 2. **Timeouts**: Clients should handle timeouts gracefully. After a timeout, they should reattempt the request while 
 *    balancing the retry frequency to prevent flooding the server.
 * 
 * 3. **Server Overhead**: Since the server keeps many connections open, it needs to manage resources like memory and CPU 
 *    effectively. Consider using **microservices architecture** with separate services handling long polling requests and 
 *    delegating data fetching to other services.
 * 
 * 4. **Security**: Since you’re keeping the connections alive for extended periods, make sure your server is secure 
 *    (use HTTPS) and that each request is authenticated properly to avoid misuse.
 * 
 * PROS AND CONS OF LONG POLLING:
 *
 * **Pros**:
 * 1. **Near Real-Time**: Provides near-real-time data without needing a constant connection like WebSockets.
 * 2. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement in any HTTP environment. Works well in environments where WebSockets are unavailable.
 * 3. **Firewall Compatibility**: Since it's based on standard HTTP, it works with most firewalls and proxies that might block WebSockets.
 *
 * **Cons**:
 * 1. **Scalability**: Maintaining millions of open connections is resource-intensive. As user load increases, it becomes 
 *    harder to scale without load balancers and horizontal scaling.
 * 2. **Latency**: Though near real-time, there may be a slight delay since the client has to reinitiate the connection 
 *    every time a response is received.
 * 3. **Increased Server Load**: Holding open connections for long periods increases the load on the server. Horizontal scaling 
 *    and efficient resource management are necessary.
 * 4. **Inefficient**: Compared to WebSockets, long polling is inefficient because it opens and closes connections repeatedly.
 * 
 * 
 * SIMPLE LONG POLLING EXAMPLE:
 *
 * Backend (Node.js):
 * 
 * const express = require('express');
 * const app = express();
 * let messages = []; // Message store
 *
 * // Long Polling endpoint
 * app.get('/long-poll', (req, res) => {
 *   if (messages.length > 0) {
 *     res.json({ messages });
 *     messages = [];
 *   } else {
 *     setTimeout(() => res.json({ messages: [] }), 30000); // Hold connection for 30s
 *   }
 * });
 * 
 * // Push message
 * app.post('/send-message', (req, res) => {
 *   messages.push("New message");
 *   res.json({ status: 'Message added' });
 * });
 * 
 * app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
 *
 * Frontend (JavaScript):
 *
 * function longPoll() {
 *   fetch('/long-poll')
 *     .then(response => response.json())
 *     .then(data => {
 *       if (data.messages.length > 0) {
 *         console.log("New messages:", data.messages); // Handle new messages
 *       }
 *       longPoll(); // Reconnect after response
 *     })
 *     .catch(err => console.error('Polling error:', err));
 * }
 * longPoll(); // Start the long-polling loop

/**                                        WEBSOCKET - IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION
 *
 *  WHAT IS WEBSOCKET CONNECTION AND HOW DOES IT WORK UNDER THE HOOD?
 * 
 *  WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides **full-duplex** communication channels over a single TCP connection.
 *  It allows for real-time, two-way communication between a client (browser) and a server, unlike HTTP, which follows a
 *  request-response model.
 * 
 *  **How It Works Under the Hood**:
 *  1. **Initial HTTP Request**: The WebSocket protocol starts with an HTTP request using the `Upgrade` header to ask the server 
 *     to switch the connection to WebSocket.
 *  2. **101 Switching Protocols**: If the server agrees to switch, it responds with a `101 Switching Protocols` status code. 
 *     This is a handshake response from the server to upgrade the connection.
 *  3. **TCP Connection**: After the handshake, both the client and the server use the same TCP connection, but it’s no longer 
 *     bound by the HTTP request-response cycle. The connection remains open and either side can send messages at any time.
 *  4. **Frames**: Data is exchanged in small packets called **frames** (control frames, data frames) using the WebSocket protocol.
 *     The frames can be text or binary, and the overhead per frame is minimal compared to HTTP.
 *  5. **Closing the Connection**: Either the client or server can close the WebSocket connection using a special "close frame".
 * 
 *  WHY IS WEBSOCKET BIDIRECTIONAL? (IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION)
 * 
 *  WebSocket is considered bidirectional because both the client and the server can send and receive messages **independently**
 *  of each other. Once the WebSocket connection is established:
 *  
 *  - **Client-to-Server Communication**: The client can send data to the server without waiting for a response.
 *  - **Server-to-Client Communication**: The server can push data to the client whenever needed, without the client initiating a request.
 * 
 *  This differs from the traditional HTTP model, which is **unidirectional** — the client makes a request, and the server responds.
 *  In WebSockets, either party can start sending data at any time, and both parties can keep the connection open as long as necessary.
 * 
 *  WHAT IS 101 SWITCHING STATUS AND WHY DOES IT START WITH HTTPS?
 * 
 *  - **101 Switching Protocols**: This is an HTTP response status code that indicates the server is switching protocols, 
 *    based on the client’s request (sent using the `Upgrade` header).
 *  - **Why HTTPS First?**: WebSocket connections are established over HTTP(S) initially. The client sends an HTTP `Upgrade` request 
 *    to the server. Once the server responds with `101 Switching Protocols`, the HTTP connection is upgraded to a WebSocket.
 *    HTTPS is required first to ensure that the connection is **secure** (using TLS) before it switches to WebSocket.
 * 
 *  WHY EXPERIENCED DEVS AVOID WEBSOCKETS (IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION)?
 * 
 *  Many experienced developers are cautious about WebSockets for several reasons:
 *  
 *  1. **Scalability**: WebSockets require maintaining an **open connection** for each client. This can overwhelm a server if 
 *     not properly managed because each connection consumes resources. Traditional HTTP is stateless, so it scales better 
 *     out of the box.
 *  
 *  2. **Resource Consumption**: WebSockets maintain a **persistent** connection for the duration of the communication. 
 *     This requires careful management of memory and resources, especially for applications with thousands or millions 
 *     of clients.
 *  
 *  3. **Server Load**: WebSocket servers need to handle **concurrency** efficiently. This is challenging for traditional 
 *     blocking server architectures. Non-blocking, event-driven architectures like Node.js or using tools like NGINX 
 *     are often necessary.
 *  
 *  4. **State Management**: WebSocket connections are **stateful**. Unlike HTTP where each request is independent, 
 *     maintaining open WebSocket connections requires more attention to resource management (e.g., memory leaks, 
 *     connection timeouts).
 *  
 *  5. **Firewall and Proxy Issues**: WebSocket traffic can be blocked by firewalls or proxies that don’t support the 
 *     protocol, making it harder to use in certain enterprise environments.
 *  
 *  6. **Idle Connections**: If clients are idle for long periods, the server still needs to keep the connection alive, 
 *     consuming resources.
 * 
 *  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WS AND WSS?
 * 
 *  - **WS (WebSocket)**: This refers to a WebSocket connection over a **plain, unencrypted** connection (similar to HTTP).
 *  - **WSS (WebSocket Secure)**: This refers to a WebSocket connection over **TLS/SSL**, meaning the data is **encrypted** 
 *    (similar to HTTPS). WSS is important for securing sensitive data, protecting the integrity of the communication.
 * 
 *  WHAT TO REVIEW WHEN USING WEBSOCKETS?
 *  
 *  1. **Security**: Ensure that you use WSS for secure communication, especially if handling sensitive data.
 *  2. **Idle Timeouts**: Close idle connections after a certain period to free up resources.
 *  3. **Connection Limits**: Set limits on the number of concurrent WebSocket connections a server can handle.
 *  4. **Resource Management**: Implement garbage collection, connection management, and resource monitoring to avoid memory leaks.
 *  5. **Handling Reconnection**: Ensure clients can reconnect gracefully if a WebSocket connection is interrupted.
 *  6. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication to ensure only authorized clients can connect to the WebSocket server.
 * 
 *  HOW TO USE WEBSOCKETS AT SCALE?
 *  
 *  1. **Load Balancing**: Use WebSocket-compatible load balancers (like **NGINX**) to distribute connections across multiple servers.
 *  2. **Clustered Architecture**: Use a **clustered architecture** where multiple servers handle WebSocket connections. 
 *     Use a shared **Redis Pub/Sub** or message queue system to distribute messages across the cluster.
 *  3. **Backpressure Management**: Ensure that your server can handle **backpressure** when too many messages are being 
 *     sent to clients too quickly, preventing buffer overflows.
 *  4. **Scaling Horizontally**: Use containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to scale horizontally, spinning up more 
 *     servers when needed.
 * 
 *  IF YOU WERE THE CREATOR OF WEBSOCKET, WHAT WOULD YOU FIX?
 * 
 *  One common critique of WebSocket is its **stateful nature**. If I were to redesign WebSocket, I would look into improving 
 *  the protocol’s ability to **scale efficiently** in stateless environments, similar to HTTP. Stateless communication 
 *  would make it easier to horizontally scale WebSocket connections across many servers.
 * 
 *  PROS AND CONS OF WEBSOCKETS FOR SCALED PROJECTS
 * 
 *  **Pros**:
 *  1. **Low Latency**: WebSocket offers low-latency, real-time communication, making it ideal for applications like 
 *     online gaming, stock trading, and live messaging.
 *  2. **Efficient**: Since WebSocket uses small data frames and avoids the overhead of traditional HTTP requests, 
 *     it’s more efficient for frequent communication.
 * 
 *  **Cons**:
 *  1. **Resource-Intensive**: WebSockets are stateful and require dedicated resources for each open connection, 
 *     which can strain servers if not managed correctly.
 *  2. **Complexity**: Managing large numbers of WebSocket connections adds complexity to resource management and 
 *     horizontal scaling.
 *  3. **Firewall Issues**: Some firewalls may block WebSocket traffic, causing accessibility problems.
 * 
 *  IN-DEPTH NETWORK FLOW FOR WEBSOCKET:
 * 
 *  1. **Initial HTTP Connection**: The client initiates an HTTP connection, sending a request to the server with the 
 *     `Upgrade: websocket` header to request switching to the WebSocket protocol.
 * 
 *  2. **Server Handshake**: The server responds with a **101 Switching Protocols** header if it agrees to upgrade the 
 *     connection to WebSocket.
 * 
 *  3. **Upgrade to WebSocket**: After the 101 response, both client and server switch to the WebSocket protocol, 
 *     and the HTTP connection is upgraded to a **persistent TCP connection**.
 * 
 *  4. **Data Flow**: Data is exchanged between the client and server in **frames**. The frames can be text, binary, 
 *     or control frames. Either side can send data independently without waiting for a response.
 * 
 *  5. **Connection Termination**: Either party can send a close frame to terminate the connection. Once the close 
 *     frame is acknowledged, the connection is closed.
 * 
 *  SIMPLE EXAMPLE USING SOCKET.IO:
 * 
 *  // Backend (Node.js with Socket.IO)
 *  const io = require('socket.io')(3000);
 * 
 *  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
 *    console.log('Client connected');
 *    
 *    // Handle client message
 *    socket.on('message', (data) => {
 *      console.log('Received message from client:', data);
 *    });
 * 
 *    // Send message to client
 *    socket.emit('welcome', 'Hello from server');
 *    
 *    // Handle disconnect
 *    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
 *      console.log('Client disconnected');
 *    });
 *  });
 * 
 *  // Frontend (JavaScript)
 *  const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
 * 
 *  socket.on('welcome', (data) => {
 *    console.log(data); // 'Hello from server'
 *  });
 * 
 *  // Send message to server
 *  socket.emit('message', 'Hello, server!');
 * 
 *  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
 *    console.log('Disconnected from server');
 *  });
