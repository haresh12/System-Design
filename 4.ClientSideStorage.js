                                                                          /** All About Client Side Storage */
  
/**  
 * 1. WHAT IS LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * Local Storage is a type of **web storage** that allows web apps  
 * to store **key-value pairs** persistently in the browser.  
 * - Unlike cookies, it is designed to store **larger amounts of data**  
 *   (5MB or more) and does not expire on its own.  
 * - **Origin-specific**: Data is stored per domain, meaning only  
 *   scripts from the same domain can access it.  
 * - Local Storage is part of the **Web Storage API**.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW DOES IT WORK UNDER THE HOOD?  
 *  
 * - Local Storage is implemented by browsers as part of the **HTML5 Web Storage API**.  
 * - Browsers typically store it in **SQLite databases** or equivalent file storage.  
 * - When you store a key-value pair, browsers serialize it and  
 *   save it on disk in these databases.  
 * - JavaScript interacts with this stored data synchronously  
 *   (i.e., it blocks other operations until it’s done).  
 * - Data is **not encrypted** and stored in **plain text**.  
 * - **Access via JavaScript**: You access Local Storage via `window.localStorage`.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. WHAT IS THE SIZE LIMIT OF LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Each browser typically limits Local Storage to **5MB per domain**.  
 * - Some browsers (Safari, Firefox) may allow slightly more,  
 *   but 5MB is a safe assumption.  
 * - **Quota Exceeded Error**: If you exceed the limit, a  
 *   `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR` is thrown.  
 * - Local Storage should not be used for **large datasets**.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. WHAT IS THE DATA STRUCTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Local Storage is a **key-value store**, where both keys and  
 *   values are stored as **strings**.  
 * - You can store other data types (arrays, objects) by converting  
 *   them to strings using `JSON.stringify()`.  
 * - Example:  
 *   ```js  
 *   const obj = {name: 'John', age: 30};  
 *   localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(obj));  
 *   const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));  
 *   console.log(user.name);  // John  
 *   ```  
 */

/**  
 * 5. HOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Persistent storage**: Data in Local Storage does not expire automatically.  
 * - Data is stored indefinitely until explicitly deleted using  
 *   `localStorage.removeItem()` or `clear()`.  
 * - If users **clear browser data** or switch to **incognito mode**,  
 *   the Local Storage can be wiped.  
 * - **Across tabs**: All tabs from the same domain share the same Local Storage,  
 *   meaning changes in one tab are reflected across others.  
 */

/**  
 * 6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LOCAL STORAGE  
 *  
 * - **Avoid storing sensitive data**: Since Local Storage is accessible  
 *   by JavaScript, it can be exposed to attacks. Never store tokens, passwords,  
 *   or PII (Personally Identifiable Information).  
 * - **XSS vulnerabilities**: If your site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting  
 *   (XSS), attackers can access Local Storage and retrieve sensitive data.  
 * - **No encryption**: Data is stored in plain text.  
 * - **Session Hijacking**: Storing session data or tokens in Local Storage  
 *   can make you vulnerable to hijacking attacks, especially on shared devices.  
 * - To mitigate XSS, you can use **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to  
 *   block the injection of malicious scripts.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE OR NOT USE LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * USE LOCAL STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - Storing **non-sensitive** data like UI preferences, application settings,  
 *   cached app state, or other small amounts of data (e.g., last visited page).  
 * - You need **persistent data** that survives page reloads and browser sessions.  
 *  
 * AVOID LOCAL STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - **Storing sensitive data**: For example, authentication tokens (JWTs),  
 *   user credentials, or personal information.  
 * - Storing **large amounts of data** (for that, consider IndexedDB or server-side storage).  
 * - Your application requires **real-time sync across multiple tabs** or users,  
 *   because Local Storage does not provide automatic sync (use IndexedDB or cookies).  
 */

/**  
 * 8. IN-DEPTH BEST EXAMPLE:  
 *  
 * Let's build a **To-Do app** that uses Local Storage to store tasks.  
 *  
 * ```js  
 * // Retrieve tasks from localStorage  
 * let tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')) || [];  
 *  
 * // Add a new task  
 * function addTask(task) {  
 *   tasks.push(task);  
 *   localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));  
 * }  
 *  
 * // Remove a task  
 * function removeTask(index) {  
 *   tasks.splice(index, 1);  
 *   localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));  
 * }  
 *  
 * // Example usage  
 * addTask('Buy milk');  
 * console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')));  // ['Buy milk']  
 *  
 * removeTask(0);  
 * console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')));  // []  
 * ```  
 *  
 * This app:  
 * 1. Adds and removes tasks to/from Local Storage.  
 * 2. Tasks persist across page reloads since they are stored in the browser.  
 * 3. If you clear the cache, tasks will be lost—highlighting one limitation.  
 * 4. **Security risk**: If the app had a XSS vulnerability, an attacker  
 *    could inject a script to steal the tasks.  
 */

/**  
 * 9. WHAT ARE 5-6 THINGS MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * 1. **Synchronous operation**: Since all operations are blocking,  
 *    heavy use of Local Storage can slow down your app.  
 * 2. **Cross-tab communication**: Changes in one tab will reflect in other  
 *    tabs because Local Storage is shared across tabs of the same domain.  
 * 3. **No expiration date**: Data is stored indefinitely unless explicitly deleted.  
 * 4. **Size limit quirks**: Different browsers and devices enforce different size  
 *    limits, so it's not always exactly 5MB.  
 * 5. **String-only storage**: Local Storage can only store strings. Complex  
 *    objects need to be serialized using `JSON.stringify()` and parsed back.  
 * 6. **Lack of security**: Many assume Local Storage is safe, but it's not  
 *    encrypted, and security-conscious developers prefer alternatives.  
 */

/**  
 * 10. ADVANCED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  
 *  
 * Q: What alternatives exist to Local Storage when dealing with larger or more complex data?  
 * A: Use **IndexedDB** for large datasets or **Session Storage** for temporary data that  
 *    should be cleared when the tab is closed. **Server-side** storage with proper  
 *    security is recommended for sensitive information.  
 *  
 * Q: Can Local Storage be accessed by third-party scripts?  
 * A: No, due to the **Same-Origin Policy**, Local Storage is scoped to the domain  
 *    from which it was created, meaning third-party scripts (from other domains)  
 *    cannot access it.  
 *  
 * Q: How can I secure Local Storage?  
 * A: Although you can't fully secure Local Storage, you can minimize risks by:  
 *    - Validating and sanitizing all user inputs.  
 *    - Using **HTTPS** to prevent data interception during transit.  
 *    - Applying **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent malicious script injection.  
 *    - Regularly clearing or refreshing Local Storage items to prevent stale data.

/**  
 * 1. WHAT IS SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * Session Storage is another form of **web storage** provided by browsers.  
 * - It allows web applications to store **temporary data** (key-value pairs)  
 *   in the browser for the duration of a **single session**.  
 * - Data stored in Session Storage is accessible **only within the tab**  
 *   or window in which it was created.  
 * - Once the tab or browser is closed, the stored data is automatically deleted.  
 * - Like Local Storage, it is a part of the **Web Storage API**.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW DOES IT WORK UNDER THE HOOD?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage works similarly to Local Storage, but it is scoped to  
 *   the **current window or tab**.  
 * - Data is stored in the browser’s **in-memory storage** and saved  
 *   temporarily for the duration of the session.  
 * - When a user opens a new tab or window, a **new storage session** is created.  
 * - The storage is still **synchronous**, meaning JavaScript blocks execution  
 *   until data is written or read from Session Storage.  
 * - The data is stored as **strings**, so like Local Storage, objects need  
 *   to be serialized with `JSON.stringify()`.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. WHAT IS THE SIZE LIMIT OF SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage is generally **limited to 5MB** per domain, similar  
 *   to Local Storage.  
 * - This limit may vary slightly depending on the browser, but  
 *   5MB is a good rule of thumb.  
 * - Attempting to store more data than allowed will result in a  
 *   `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR`.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. WHAT IS THE DATA STRUCTURE OF SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage is also a **key-value store**, just like Local Storage.  
 * - Both **keys and values are strings**.  
 * - You can store objects and arrays by converting them into strings using  
 *   `JSON.stringify()`, and retrieve them using `JSON.parse()`.  
 * - Example:  
 *   ```js  
 *   const userData = {name: 'Alice', age: 25};  
 *   sessionStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));  
 *   const user = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('user'));  
 *   console.log(user.name);  // Alice  
 *   ```  
 */

/**  
 * 5. HOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Session-based**: Data in Session Storage is persistent only for the  
 *   **lifetime of the tab or window**.  
 * - When the user **closes the tab or window**, all data stored in  
 *   Session Storage is automatically deleted.  
 * - **Navigation**: Data persists if you reload the page or navigate within  
 *   the same tab (unless explicitly cleared).  
 * - **Cross-tab behavior**: Unlike Local Storage, each tab or window  
 *   has its own isolated Session Storage.  
 */

/**

 * - **No encryption**: The data is stored in plain text and can be exposed.  
 * - **Session fixation risks**: In some cases, attackers can steal Session Storage  
 *   data through XSS, but since it is limited to a single tab or window,  
 *   it reduces long-term exposure.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE OR NOT USE SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * USE SESSION STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - You need to store **temporary data** that is relevant to a single session,  
 *   like form inputs, one-time use data, or page-specific preferences.  
 * - You want data to **disappear** when the user closes the tab or window.  
 * - You don’t need data to persist across multiple visits or between tabs.  
 *  
 * AVOID SESSION STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - You need data to persist across multiple tabs or windows.  
 * - You are working with **sensitive data** that shouldn't be exposed  
 *   to potential XSS attacks (e.g., tokens or personal information).  
 * - You are storing **large datasets** (consider using IndexedDB for large,  
 *   complex data structures).  
 */

/**  
 * 8. IN-DEPTH BEST EXAMPLE:  
 *  
 * Let's build a **shopping cart** where items are temporarily stored  
 * in Session Storage (useful for guest checkouts).  
 *  
 * ```js  
 * // Retrieve cart from sessionStorage  
 * let cart = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('cart')) || [];  
 *  
 * // Add an item to the cart  
 * function addItemToCart(item) {  
 *   cart.push(item);

 * console.log(JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('cart')));  
 * ```  
 *  
 * In this example:  
 * 1. Items are stored temporarily for the current session (tab).  
 * 2. If the user closes the tab, the cart will be cleared—ideal for temporary carts.  
 * 3. This ensures that **session state** is isolated and won't persist between sessions.  
 */

/**  
 * 9. WHY DOES DUPLICATING A TAB BEHAVE WEIRDLY WITH SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Behavior of Duplicate Tabs**:  
 *   When you duplicate a tab (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+T), the browser creates a  
 *   new session, but **Session Storage** is sometimes copied from the original tab.  
 * - This happens because the **tab cloning process** duplicates the session data  
 *   from the original tab, which can cause unexpected behavior, especially if  
 *   you're managing session-specific states (e.g., form progress, shopping carts).  
 * - In some cases, both tabs might share the same data temporarily, but since  
 *   each tab still has **separate Session Storage**, any subsequent changes  
 *   won’t sync between them.  
 *  
 * **In-Depth Behavior Explanation**:  
 * - When a tab is cloned, browsers might **clone the session state** along  
 *   with the tab itself. This can lead to strange behavior where two tabs  
 *   seem to have the same Session Storage for a brief time.  
 * - However, as soon as any changes are made in either tab, their Session  
 *   Storage will **diverge** and behave independently.  
 * - This issue can be a problem if you're using Session Storage to track  
 *   session-based data like shopping carts or user progress.  
 * - To mitigate this, it’s best to have a **unique session identifier** for  
 *   each tab that is stored in Session Storage to avoid data collisions.  
 */

/**  
 * 10. WHAT ARE 5-6 THINGS MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * 1. **Scoped per tab**: Unlike Local Storage, Session Storage is scoped  
 *    to the specific tab or window, which makes it better for single-session data.  
 * 2. **Tab duplication quirks**: As mentioned, duplicating a tab can result  
 *    in Session Storage being copied temporarily, leading to unexpected results.  
 * 3. **Synchronous operation**: Just like Local Storage, Session Storage  
 *    operations block JavaScript execution. Heavy operations may slow your app.  
 * 4. **Temporary storage**: Data is deleted as soon as the tab or window  
 *    is closed, which makes it less risky than Local Storage for sensitive data.  
 * 5. **String-only storage**: Developers often overlook the fact that  
 *    you need to serialize and deserialize objects using JSON.  
 * 6. **Cross-tab isolation**: Session Storage is **isolated** between tabs,  
 *    meaning each tab has its own independent Session Storage even if  
 *    the same domain is loaded in both.  
 */

/**  
 * 11. ADVANCED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  
 *  
 * Q: What is the difference between Session Storage and Local Storage in terms of persistence?  
 * A: **Session Storage** only persists data for the lifetime of a tab or window,  
 *    meaning it is deleted as soon as the tab is closed. **Local Storage**, on the other hand,  
 *    persists data indefinitely until it is explicitly deleted by the application or the user.  
 *  
 * Q: How do you avoid duplication issues when using Session Storage in duplicated tabs?  
 * A: Use a **unique session identifier** (like a random string) in each tab,  
 *    stored in Session Storage. When a tab is duplicated, generate a new session ID,  
 *    so each tab has distinct Session Storage, even if cloned initially.  
 *  
 * Q: Can Session Storage be accessed by scripts from different domains?  
 * A: No, Session Storage is scoped by the **Same-Origin Policy**,  
 *    meaning scripts from different domains cannot access it.  
 *  
 * Q: What alternatives are there for handling temporary data across multiple tabs?  
 * A: You can use **SharedWorkers** or **BroadcastChannel API** to share  
 *    temporary state between tabs without relying on Session Storage.

                                                                  /** Cookies */
  
                                                                
/**  
 * 1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?  
 *  
 * - **Cookies** are small pieces of data (key-value pairs) sent from the server  
 *   and stored in the user's browser. They are used to maintain **stateful information**  
 *   across different sessions or requests.  
 * - Cookies allow servers to remember important data, like **login sessions**,  
 *   **user preferences**, or **tracking information** for analytics.  
 * - Cookies are stored as **plain text** and are tied to specific domains.  
 * - They are automatically sent back to the server with each HTTP request  
 *   for the associated domain, making them a convenient way to persist data  
 *   between client-server interactions.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW CAN COOKIES BE SET FROM BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER?  
 *  
 * **Client-side** (JavaScript):  
 * - You can set cookies directly in the browser using the `document.cookie` API.  
 *   Example:  
 *   ```js  
 *   document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT; path=/;";  
 *   ```  
 *   This will create a cookie named `username` with the value `JohnDoe` that expires  
 *   on **December 31, 2024**, and is accessible across the entire domain (`path=/`).  
 *  
 * **Server-side**:  
 * - The server can set cookies by sending the `Set-Cookie` header in the HTTP response.  
 *   Example (Node.js Express server):  
 *   ```js  
 *   res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'username=JohnDoe; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict');  
 *   ```  
 *   This will create a cookie on the client's browser. The **HttpOnly** attribute makes  
 *   the cookie **inaccessible to JavaScript**, while the **Secure** attribute ensures  
 *   the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.  
 *  
 * - **Important distinction**: When a cookie is set from the server, it often comes  
 *   with additional flags (like `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), which control  
 *   how and when the client can access or use the cookie.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "SERVER CAN ALWAYS READ CLIENT-SIDE COOKIES, BUT THE CLIENT MAY OR MAY NOT READ BASED ON SERVER SETUP"?  
 *  
 * - **Server Can Always Read**:  
 *   Every time the browser makes a request to the server, cookies set for that domain  
 *   are automatically included in the HTTP headers (`Cookie` header). This means the server  
 *   can always read the cookies it has set, unless the cookie has expired or was explicitly deleted.  
 *  
 * - **Client May or May Not Read**:  
 *   - When the server sets a cookie, it can add the `HttpOnly` flag, which makes the cookie  
 *     **inaccessible** to client-side JavaScript via `document.cookie`. This improves security by  
 *     preventing XSS attacks from stealing cookies.  
 *   - Cookies with the `HttpOnly` attribute are invisible to JavaScript and can only be accessed  
 *     by the server.  
 *  
 *   - Example of `HttpOnly` cookie (client **cannot** read):  
 *     ```  
 *     Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict  
 *     ```  
 *     Here, the **sessionId** cookie is protected and **JavaScript on the client cannot access it**.  
 *  
 *   - Example of regular cookie (client **can** read):  
 *     ```js  
 *     document.cookie = "theme=dark; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";  
 *     console.log(document.cookie);  // theme=dark  
 *     ```  
 *  
 *   **Key takeaway**: The server can always read cookies sent by the browser, but client-side  
 *   JavaScript can only access cookies that are **not** marked with the `HttpOnly` flag.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. HOW DOES COOKIE DATA PERSISTENCE WORK?  
 *  
 * - **Session Cookies**:  
 *   - These cookies are **temporary** and are deleted when the browser is closed.  
 *   - They don’t have an `expires` or `max-age` attribute.  
 *  
 * - **Persistent Cookies**:  
 *   - These cookies persist even after the browser is closed.  
 *   - They have a specific **expiration date** (`expires`) or a **max-age** attribute.  
 *   - Example:  
 *     ```js  
 *     document.cookie = "user=Alice; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT;";  
 *     ```  
 *  
 * - **Secure Cookies**:  
 *   - Cookies set with the `Secure` flag are only sent over **HTTPS** connections.  
 *   - They reduce the risk of cookie interception on unsecured (HTTP) connections.  
 */

/**  
 * 5. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR COOKIES (VERY DEEP UNDERSTANDING)  
 *  
 * - **HttpOnly**:  
 *   - This flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing cookies.  
 *   - Use this for cookies that store **session IDs**, authentication tokens,  
 *     or other sensitive data to prevent XSS attacks from stealing them.  
 *  
 * - **Secure**:  
 *   - This flag ensures the cookie is only sent over **secure, encrypted HTTPS connections**.  
 *   - It prevents attackers from intercepting cookies over an insecure network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).  
 *  
 * - **SameSite**:  
 *   - This flag controls whether cookies are sent with **cross-site requests**.  
 *   - Possible values:  
 *     1. **Strict**: Cookies are only sent with requests from the **same site**. Prevents CSRF.  
 *     2. **Lax**: Cookies are sent with top-level navigation requests (GET), but not with cross-site sub-requests.  
 *     3. **None**: Cookies are sent with **all** requests, but this must be used with the `Secure` flag.  
 *  
 * - **CSRF Protection**:  
 *   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks can exploit cookies. Use **SameSite=Strict** or **Lax**  
 *     for session cookies and use CSRF tokens for extra security.  
 *  
 * - **Expiration and Deletion**:  
 *   - Cookies should have appropriate **expiration times**. Persistent cookies should have short lifespans  
 *     for sensitive information to reduce the attack surface.  
 *  
 * - **Subdomain and Path Scoping**:  
 *   - Limit cookies to specific **subdomains** and **paths** to ensure they are only sent with relevant requests.  
 *   - Example: `domain=sub.example.com; path=/secure-area/`  
 *  
 * - **Encryption**:  
 *   - Cookies can be **encrypted** on the server side (e.g., using JWTs). The server signs the cookie  
 *     to ensure its contents haven’t been tampered with.  
 */

/**  
 * 6. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE OR NOT USE COOKIES?  
 *  
 * USE COOKIES WHEN:  
 * - You need to store **small amounts of data** that need to be sent back  
 *   to the server with each request, such as **authentication tokens**,  
 *   **session IDs**, or **user preferences**.  
 * - You require **data persistence** across different sessions or devices,  
 *   like for "remember me" functionality.  
 *  
 * AVOID COOKIES WHEN:  
 * - You are handling **large data** (use Local Storage, Session Storage, or IndexedDB).  
 * - You are storing **sensitive data** like passwords, private keys, or personal info  
 *   (this should be stored securely on the server, not in cookies).  
 * - You need to store data that is not essential to be sent with every request  
 *   (consider Local/Session Storage for client-only data).

/**  
 * 7. IN-DEPTH EXAMPLE:  
 *  
 * Let's demonstrate how to set, read, and manage cookies from both the client and server.

 *  
 * **Client-side example**:  
 * ```js  
 * // Set a cookie that expires in 7 days  
 * const now = new Date();  
 * now.setTime(now.getTime() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);  // 7 days

 *  
 * // Delete a cookie by setting an expired date  
 * document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/;";  
 * ```  
 *  
 * **Server-side example (Node.js)**:

 *   });  
 *   res.send('Cookie is set!');  
 * });  
 * ```  
 *  
 * **Important Notes**:  
 * - On the **client**, you can access cookies via `document.cookie` (if not HttpOnly).  
 * - On the **server**, cookies are automatically included in the **request headers**  
 *   for every HTTP request to that server.

/**  
 * 8. ADVANCED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT COOKIES:  
 *  
 * Q: What happens if two cookies have the same name but different paths or domains?  
 * A: Cookies can have the same name if their paths or domains differ,  
 *    but they are treated as **distinct** by the browser. However, conflicts may arise  
 *    if cookies share a path and domain. In such cases, the most specific match is returned first.  
 *  
 * Q: Can cookies be accessed cross-domain?  
 * A: Cookies are limited by **Same-Origin Policy**. You can only access cookies set for the current domain.  
 *    For cross-domain cookies, you would need to set specific `domain` attributes or use other methods like CORS.  
 *  
 * Q: How can I ensure cookie data integrity?  
 * A: Use **signed cookies** with encryption algorithms (like HMAC) to detect any tampering.

                                                    /** DEEP UNDERSTANDING MUST GO WHY HTTP ONLY COOKIES NEEDED EVEN IF CLIENT CAN NOT READ IT */
 
/**  
 * 1. WHAT IS THE USE OF A COOKIE THAT THE CLIENT CANNOT READ?  
 *  
 * - These cookies are set with the **`HttpOnly`** flag, which ensures  
 *   that they cannot be accessed or modified by **JavaScript** running  
 *   on the browser. Only the **server** can read and modify them.  
 *  
 * - Use cases:  
 *    - **Session management**  
 *    - **Authentication**  
 *    - **Security tokens**  
 *    - **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection**  
 *  
 *   By restricting client access, such cookies help in improving the security  
 *   of sensitive data and preventing vulnerabilities like **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. EXAMPLES OF USE CASES:  
 *  
 * **1. Session Management**:  
 * - **Session cookies** often carry a unique session identifier (e.g., `sessionId`) that the server uses  
 *   to keep track of an authenticated user across different requests.  
 * - Since session IDs are sensitive, **`HttpOnly`** prevents malicious scripts (like those injected via XSS)  
 *   from stealing them.  
 * - Even though the client cannot access this session cookie, every subsequent request automatically  
 *   includes the cookie in the HTTP header, allowing the server to associate the request with the correct session.  
 * - Without the **`HttpOnly`** flag, an attacker might be able to steal the session ID using a script and impersonate the user.  
 *  
 * **Example**:  
 * ```js  
 * Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict  
 * ```  
 *  
 *   - The **client** cannot read the `sessionId`, but the **browser** automatically sends it to the server  
 *     on every request made to that domain.  
 *   - The server uses this session ID to fetch the appropriate session data (e.g., user authentication)  
 *     and ensure continuity across multiple requests.  
 *  
 * **2. Authentication and Security Tokens**:  
 * - **HttpOnly** cookies can store **authentication tokens** (like **JWTs** or OAuth tokens) safely.  
 * - These tokens are automatically included in HTTP requests without exposing them to JavaScript,  
 *   preventing them from being stolen through XSS attacks.  
 *  
 * **3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**:  
 * - The **CSRF** attack trick users into making requests that they didn’t intend to. By using **HttpOnly** cookies  
 *   and pairing them with **CSRF tokens** (sent via a custom header or form), the server can protect against this attack.  
 * - Since **HttpOnly** prevents malicious scripts from stealing cookies, the server can trust that the cookie has not been tampered with.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. DEEP EXPLANATION ON HOW IT WORKS:  
 *  
 * **What Happens Under the Hood?**  
 * - When the server sets a cookie with **`HttpOnly`**, the browser automatically stores it and sends it back  
 *   with every future HTTP request made to that domain. The browser handles the cookie **transparently**,  
 *   meaning the cookie is included in the **request headers** without any JavaScript interaction.  
 *  
 *   - **Example HTTP request with `HttpOnly` cookie included in headers**:  
 *     ```http  
 *     GET /profile HTTP/1.1  
 *     Host: www.example.com  
 *     Cookie: sessionId=abc123  
 *     ```  
 *  
 *   - The **client-side JavaScript** is completely unaware of this cookie's value, but the **server** can read  
 *     it on every request to ensure the request is associated with the correct user session or authenticated user.  
 *  
 * **Benefit for the Server**:  
 * - The server receives the cookie data without needing to expose it to potentially vulnerable client-side code.  
 * - The server can then use this cookie for **stateful interactions**, such as recognizing an authenticated session,  
 *   handling sensitive operations (e.g., account settings), or even setting **user preferences** securely.  
 * - By limiting the cookie to **server access only**, you eliminate the risk of **malicious scripts** (via XSS)  
 *   accessing it, thus protecting sensitive information (like session IDs or tokens).  
 */

/**  
 * 4. EXAMPLES OF `HttpOnly` USE CASES:  
 *  
 * **Session Authentication (Login Scenario)**:  
 * - When a user logs in, the server creates a unique session ID and stores it in an `HttpOnly` cookie.  
 * - The server responds with something like this:  
 *   ```http  
 *   Set-Cookie: sessionId=xyz789; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict  
 *   ```  
 * - On every subsequent request, the browser includes this cookie in the request,  
 *   and the server can use it to validate the session.  
 * - The client-side JavaScript cannot read or manipulate this session cookie.  
 *  
 * **Security Tokens (JWT Authentication)**:  
 * - A common practice is to store **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** in **HttpOnly** cookies.  
 * - This way, JavaScript cannot read the JWT or tamper with it, ensuring that the token is used  
 *   securely for validating requests.  
 *  
 *   Example:  
 *   ```js  
 *   Set-Cookie: jwtToken=eyJhbGciOi...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax;  
 *   ```  
 *  
 *   - **Benefit**: Even though the JWT contains sensitive user info (e.g., roles, claims), it is shielded  
 *     from client-side access and remains protected.  
 */

/**  
 * 5. WHY USE `HttpOnly` COOKIES INSTEAD OF STORING TOKENS IN LOCAL STORAGE OR SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Local Storage/Session Storage**:  
 *   - Both are vulnerable to **XSS attacks**, where an attacker can execute scripts in the user's browser  
 *     and steal any sensitive information stored there.  
 *   - If you store **authentication tokens** in Local Storage, a successful XSS attack can compromise  
 *     the token, leading to account takeover or other malicious activity.  
 *  
 * - **HttpOnly Cookies**:  
 *   - These cookies are immune to XSS attacks because they are not exposed to the browser's JavaScript environment.  
 *   - Since only the server can access the cookie, it remains much more secure, making it an ideal place  
 *     to store sensitive session or authentication information.  
 */

/**  
 * 6. COMMON USE CASE: PROTECTING SESSION ID WITH `HttpOnly` COOKIES  
 *  
 * **Why is this important?**  
 * - **Session Hijacking**: An attacker can try to steal the user's session ID (often stored in cookies)  
 *   by injecting malicious scripts into the website via XSS attacks.  
 * - If the session ID is stored in **Local Storage** or **regular cookies** (without the `HttpOnly` flag),  
 *   the script can access it and send it to the attacker's server.  
 * - The attacker can then impersonate the user by sending the stolen session ID in subsequent requests.  
 *  
 * **How `HttpOnly` Helps**:  
 * - The session cookie cannot be accessed by any script running in the browser.  
 * - Even if an attacker successfully injects a script, the session ID remains protected,  
 *   since only the server can see or use it.  
 * - By adding the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, the cookie is much harder to steal or tamper with.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. DOWNSIDES OF `HttpOnly` COOKIES  
 *  
 * - Since the client-side JavaScript cannot access `HttpOnly` cookies, you can't use them  
 *   for **client-side logic** that depends on the cookie data.  
 *   - For example, if you store a user's **theme preference** in an `HttpOnly` cookie,  
 *     JavaScript won’t be able to read it to change the theme without an extra server request.  
 *  
 * - Not suited for all data storage. If you need the client to work with some data (e.g., UI state),  
 *   using **Local Storage** or **Session Storage** may be more appropriate for non-sensitive data.

                                                       /** INDEX DB */



 /**  
 * 1. WHAT IS INDEXEDDB?  
 *  
 * - **IndexedDB** is a low-level, NoSQL database built into the browser for storing large amounts of structured data.  
 *   Unlike **localStorage** and **sessionStorage**, IndexedDB is a **true database** that supports complex querying,  
 *   transactions, and indexing. It stores data **key-value pairs** (similar to objects in JavaScript), but it's  
 *   much more powerful since it allows for **large-scale data** storage and advanced searching.  
 *  
 * - **Asynchronous**: IndexedDB operates asynchronously, meaning it doesn’t block the main browser thread like other  
 *   storages. Data is stored in a **non-blocking** way, making it suitable for web apps that require performance.  
 *  
 * - **Large capacity**: While **localStorage** is limited to ~5MB, **IndexedDB** can store **hundreds of megabytes**  
 *   or even **gigabytes** of data, depending on browser and user permissions.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW DOES INDEXEDDB WORK UNDER THE HOOD?  
 *  
 * - IndexedDB is based on a **key-value** store (similar to how databases like **MongoDB** work).  
 * - It's a **transaction-based database**: You perform all operations within the context of a transaction  
 *   (e.g., reading, writing, deleting).  
 *  
 * - Data is organized into **object stores** (think of these like tables in a relational database).  
 * - Within each **object store**, each record has a **key** and a **value**. The key is unique,  
 *   so you can query data efficiently.  
 *  
 * - IndexedDB also supports **indexes**, which let you query based on fields other than the primary key.  
 *   This makes it more flexible and powerful than **localStorage** or **sessionStorage**.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. SIZE LIMIT OF INDEXEDDB?  
 *  
 * - IndexedDB doesn’t have a hard size limit like **localStorage** (~5MB). The storage limit is **huge**,  
 *   often allowing **hundreds of megabytes** or even **gigabytes**.  
 * - The size limit depends on factors like the browser and the user’s disk space. Some browsers will prompt the user  
 *   for permission when the storage exceeds certain thresholds.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. DATA STRUCTURE OF INDEXEDDB?  
 *  
 * - Data in IndexedDB is stored in **object stores** (equivalent to tables in SQL).  
 * - You interact with these object stores using **key-value pairs**.  
 * - IndexedDB supports advanced data structures like **indexes** for searching.  
 *  
 * **Example**:  
 * ```js  
 * const request = indexedDB.open('MyDatabase', 1);  // Open the database  
 * request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {  
 *   const db = event.target.result;  
 *   const objectStore = db.createObjectStore('users', { keyPath: 'id' });  // Create object store  
 *   objectStore.createIndex('email', 'email', { unique: true });  // Create an index  
 * };  
 * ```  
 */

/**  
 * 5. HOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN INDEXEDDB?  
 *  
 * - IndexedDB is **persistent**, meaning data stored will remain there even after the browser is closed or  
 *   refreshed, similar to **localStorage**.  
 * - The data will persist **indefinitely** unless the user or the application explicitly deletes it.  
 * - The **storage quota** is typically larger than localStorage and depends on browser rules and user permissions.  
 * - **Storage eviction**: If the user’s disk space is low, the browser might clear some old data, but this is rare.  
 */

/**  
 * 6. SECURITY CONCERNS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR INDEXEDDB?  
 *  
 * - **Same-origin policy**: Like localStorage and cookies, IndexedDB is subject to the **same-origin policy**.  
 *   Data in IndexedDB can only be accessed by pages from the same domain.  
 *  
 * - **Sensitive data**: Do not store sensitive data (passwords, personal information) in IndexedDB in plain text,  
 *   since the database can be accessed by other scripts running on the same origin.  
 *   Always **encrypt sensitive data** before storing it.  
 *  
 * - **XSS vulnerabilities**: Although IndexedDB itself is secure, you should avoid storing executable scripts  
 *   or user-generated content that might be exploited via **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.  
 *  
 * - **No HttpOnly equivalent**: Unlike cookies, IndexedDB does not have something like `HttpOnly`,  
 *   meaning it can be accessed from the client-side JavaScript. This increases the risk of malicious code accessing it.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE INDEXEDDB AND WHEN NOT TO?  
 *  
 * **When to use IndexedDB**:  
 * - **Large-scale data**: When you need to store large amounts of structured data, like user profiles,  
 *   app state, or even entire document caches.  
 * - **Complex querying**: If your web app needs to search or query data based on multiple fields or indexes.  
 * - **Offline-first apps**: IndexedDB is great for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) or apps that work offline.  
 *  
 * **When NOT to use IndexedDB**:  
 * - **Small data storage**: If you just need to store small amounts of data (like user settings or tokens),  
 *   use **localStorage** or **cookies**.  
 * - **Simple data**: If your app only needs to store simple key-value pairs, IndexedDB might be overkill.  
 */

/**  
 * 8. ADVANCED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT INDEXEDDB  
 *  
 * Q: Why is IndexedDB asynchronous?  
 * A: IndexedDB is asynchronous to avoid blocking the main thread, as data operations might involve large files  
 *    or multiple transactions. Blocking the main thread would make your app sluggish and unresponsive.  
 *  
 * Q: What are **indexes** in IndexedDB?  
 * A: Indexes are similar to those in SQL databases. They allow you to create additional queryable fields  
 *    for fast searching. For example, you can query by email even if email is not the primary key.  
 *  
 * Q: What is the **upgrade event** in IndexedDB?  
 * A: If you need to change the database structure (e.g., add a new object store), you perform these changes  
 *    in the **onupgradeneeded** event handler when opening the database.  
 */

/**  
 * 9. MAKING INDEXEDDB EASIER WITH LIBRARIES:  
 *  
 * IndexedDB can be complex to use directly, especially due to its **asynchronous nature**  
 * and **transaction management**. Luckily, there are libraries that simplify working with IndexedDB.  
 *  
 * **Dexie.js**:  
 * - Dexie is a lightweight wrapper around IndexedDB that simplifies queries, transactions, and promises.  
 * - It offers a much more intuitive API for developers, making it easier to work with IndexedDB.  
 *  
 * **Example using Dexie.js**:  
 * ```js  
 * const db = new Dexie('MyDatabase');  
 * db.version(1).stores({  
 *   users: '++id, name, email',  // Create an object store with auto-incrementing id  
 * });  
 *  
 * // Add data  
 * db.users.add({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });  
 *  
 * // Query data  
 * db.users.where('email').equals('john@example.com').first().then(user => {  
 *   console.log(user.name);  
 * });  
 * ```  
 *  
 * **LocalForage**:  
 * - **LocalForage** is another library that offers a simple API and abstracts the differences between  
 *   IndexedDB, localStorage, and WebSQL. It automatically picks the best available storage method.  
 *  
 * **Other Libraries**:  
 * - **idb**: A promise-based IndexedDB library with a minimal API.  
 * - **PouchDB**: A more full-featured database built on IndexedDB, designed for offline-first apps.  
 */

/**  
 * 10. EXTRA TIPS MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT INDEXEDDB:  
 *  
 * - **Multi-key indexes**: You can create **compound indexes** that index multiple fields,  
 *   which can improve query performance for complex searches.  
 *  
 * - **Bulk transactions**: IndexedDB is really powerful for handling bulk operations like importing large datasets  
 *   in a single transaction.  
 *  
 * - **Versioning**: Every time you change your IndexedDB schema (like adding a new object store or index),  
 *   you need to increment the database version and handle schema upgrades in the **onupgradeneeded** event.
