                                                                          /** All About Client Side Storage */
  
/**  
 * 1. WHAT IS LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * Local Storage is a type of **web storage** that allows web apps  
 * to store **key-value pairs** persistently in the browser.  
 * - Unlike cookies, it is designed to store **larger amounts of data**  
 *   (5MB or more) and does not expire on its own.  
 * - **Origin-specific**: Data is stored per domain, meaning only  
 *   scripts from the same domain can access it.  
 * - Local Storage is part of the **Web Storage API**.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW DOES IT WORK UNDER THE HOOD?  
 *  
 * - Local Storage is implemented by browsers as part of the **HTML5 Web Storage API**.  
 * - Browsers typically store it in **SQLite databases** or equivalent file storage.  
 * - When you store a key-value pair, browsers serialize it and  
 *   save it on disk in these databases.  
 * - JavaScript interacts with this stored data synchronously  
 *   (i.e., it blocks other operations until it’s done).  
 * - Data is **not encrypted** and stored in **plain text**.  
 * - **Access via JavaScript**: You access Local Storage via `window.localStorage`.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. WHAT IS THE SIZE LIMIT OF LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Each browser typically limits Local Storage to **5MB per domain**.  
 * - Some browsers (Safari, Firefox) may allow slightly more,  
 *   but 5MB is a safe assumption.  
 * - **Quota Exceeded Error**: If you exceed the limit, a  
 *   `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR` is thrown.  
 * - Local Storage should not be used for **large datasets**.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. WHAT IS THE DATA STRUCTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Local Storage is a **key-value store**, where both keys and  
 *   values are stored as **strings**.  
 * - You can store other data types (arrays, objects) by converting  
 *   them to strings using `JSON.stringify()`.  
 * - Example:  
 *   ```js  
 *   const obj = {name: 'John', age: 30};  
 *   localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(obj));  
 *   const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));  
 *   console.log(user.name);  // John  
 *   ```  
 */

/**  
 * 5. HOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Persistent storage**: Data in Local Storage does not expire automatically.  
 * - Data is stored indefinitely until explicitly deleted using  
 *   `localStorage.removeItem()` or `clear()`.  
 * - If users **clear browser data** or switch to **incognito mode**,  
 *   the Local Storage can be wiped.  
 * - **Across tabs**: All tabs from the same domain share the same Local Storage,  
 *   meaning changes in one tab are reflected across others.  
 */

/**  
 * 6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LOCAL STORAGE  
 *  
 * - **Avoid storing sensitive data**: Since Local Storage is accessible  
 *   by JavaScript, it can be exposed to attacks. Never store tokens, passwords,  
 *   or PII (Personally Identifiable Information).  
 * - **XSS vulnerabilities**: If your site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting  
 *   (XSS), attackers can access Local Storage and retrieve sensitive data.  
 * - **No encryption**: Data is stored in plain text.  
 * - **Session Hijacking**: Storing session data or tokens in Local Storage  
 *   can make you vulnerable to hijacking attacks, especially on shared devices.  
 * - To mitigate XSS, you can use **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to  
 *   block the injection of malicious scripts.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE OR NOT USE LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * USE LOCAL STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - Storing **non-sensitive** data like UI preferences, application settings,  
 *   cached app state, or other small amounts of data (e.g., last visited page).  
 * - You need **persistent data** that survives page reloads and browser sessions.  
 *  
 * AVOID LOCAL STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - **Storing sensitive data**: For example, authentication tokens (JWTs),  
 *   user credentials, or personal information.  
 * - Storing **large amounts of data** (for that, consider IndexedDB or server-side storage).  
 * - Your application requires **real-time sync across multiple tabs** or users,  
 *   because Local Storage does not provide automatic sync (use IndexedDB or cookies).  
 */

/**  
 * 8. IN-DEPTH BEST EXAMPLE:  
 *  
 * Let's build a **To-Do app** that uses Local Storage to store tasks.  
 *  
 * ```js  
 * // Retrieve tasks from localStorage  
 * let tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')) || [];  
 *  
 * // Add a new task  
 * function addTask(task) {  
 *   tasks.push(task);  
 *   localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));  
 * }  
 *  
 * // Remove a task  
 * function removeTask(index) {  
 *   tasks.splice(index, 1);  
 *   localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));  
 * }  
 *  
 * // Example usage  
 * addTask('Buy milk');  
 * console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')));  // ['Buy milk']  
 *  
 * removeTask(0);  
 * console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')));  // []  
 * ```  
 *  
 * This app:  
 * 1. Adds and removes tasks to/from Local Storage.  
 * 2. Tasks persist across page reloads since they are stored in the browser.  
 * 3. If you clear the cache, tasks will be lost—highlighting one limitation.  
 * 4. **Security risk**: If the app had a XSS vulnerability, an attacker  
 *    could inject a script to steal the tasks.  
 */

/**  
 * 9. WHAT ARE 5-6 THINGS MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOCAL STORAGE?  
 *  
 * 1. **Synchronous operation**: Since all operations are blocking,  
 *    heavy use of Local Storage can slow down your app.  
 * 2. **Cross-tab communication**: Changes in one tab will reflect in other  
 *    tabs because Local Storage is shared across tabs of the same domain.  
 * 3. **No expiration date**: Data is stored indefinitely unless explicitly deleted.  
 * 4. **Size limit quirks**: Different browsers and devices enforce different size  
 *    limits, so it's not always exactly 5MB.  
 * 5. **String-only storage**: Local Storage can only store strings. Complex  
 *    objects need to be serialized using `JSON.stringify()` and parsed back.  
 * 6. **Lack of security**: Many assume Local Storage is safe, but it's not  
 *    encrypted, and security-conscious developers prefer alternatives.  
 */

/**  
 * 10. ADVANCED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  
 *  
 * Q: What alternatives exist to Local Storage when dealing with larger or more complex data?  
 * A: Use **IndexedDB** for large datasets or **Session Storage** for temporary data that  
 *    should be cleared when the tab is closed. **Server-side** storage with proper  
 *    security is recommended for sensitive information.  
 *  
 * Q: Can Local Storage be accessed by third-party scripts?  
 * A: No, due to the **Same-Origin Policy**, Local Storage is scoped to the domain  
 *    from which it was created, meaning third-party scripts (from other domains)  
 *    cannot access it.  
 *  
 * Q: How can I secure Local Storage?  
 * A: Although you can't fully secure Local Storage, you can minimize risks by:  
 *    - Validating and sanitizing all user inputs.  
 *    - Using **HTTPS** to prevent data interception during transit.  
 *    - Applying **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent malicious script injection.  
 *    - Regularly clearing or refreshing Local Storage items to prevent stale data.

/**  
 * 1. WHAT IS SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * Session Storage is another form of **web storage** provided by browsers.  
 * - It allows web applications to store **temporary data** (key-value pairs)  
 *   in the browser for the duration of a **single session**.  
 * - Data stored in Session Storage is accessible **only within the tab**  
 *   or window in which it was created.  
 * - Once the tab or browser is closed, the stored data is automatically deleted.  
 * - Like Local Storage, it is a part of the **Web Storage API**.  
 */

/**  
 * 2. HOW DOES IT WORK UNDER THE HOOD?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage works similarly to Local Storage, but it is scoped to  
 *   the **current window or tab**.  
 * - Data is stored in the browser’s **in-memory storage** and saved  
 *   temporarily for the duration of the session.  
 * - When a user opens a new tab or window, a **new storage session** is created.  
 * - The storage is still **synchronous**, meaning JavaScript blocks execution  
 *   until data is written or read from Session Storage.  
 * - The data is stored as **strings**, so like Local Storage, objects need  
 *   to be serialized with `JSON.stringify()`.  
 */

/**  
 * 3. WHAT IS THE SIZE LIMIT OF SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage is generally **limited to 5MB** per domain, similar  
 *   to Local Storage.  
 * - This limit may vary slightly depending on the browser, but  
 *   5MB is a good rule of thumb.  
 * - Attempting to store more data than allowed will result in a  
 *   `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR`.  
 */

/**  
 * 4. WHAT IS THE DATA STRUCTURE OF SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - Session Storage is also a **key-value store**, just like Local Storage.

 *   sessionStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));  
 *   const user = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('user'));  
 *   console.log(user.name);  // Alice  
 *   ```  
 */

/**  
 * 5. HOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Session-based**: Data in Session Storage is persistent only for the  
 *   **lifetime of the tab or window**.  
 * - When the user **closes the tab or window**, all data stored in  
 *   Session Storage is automatically deleted.  
 * - **Navigation**: Data persists if you reload the page or navigate within  
 *   the same tab (unless explicitly cleared).  
 * - **Cross-tab behavior**: Unlike Local Storage, each tab or window  
 *   has its own isolated Session Storage.  
 */

/**

 *   is accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to XSS attacks.  
 * - **No encryption**: The data is stored in plain text and can be exposed.  
 * - **Session fixation risks**: In some cases, attackers can steal Session Storage

 *   it reduces long-term exposure.  
 */

/**  
 * 7. WHEN SHOULD YOU USE OR NOT USE SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * USE SESSION STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - You need to store **temporary data** that is relevant to a single session,  
 *   like form inputs, one-time use data, or page-specific preferences.  
 * - You want data to **disappear** when the user closes the tab or window.  
 * - You don’t need data to persist across multiple visits or between tabs.  
 *  
 * AVOID SESSION STORAGE WHEN:  
 * - You need data to persist across multiple tabs or windows.  
 * - You are working with **sensitive data** that shouldn't be exposed  
 *   to potential XSS attacks (e.g., tokens or personal information).  
 * - You are storing **large datasets** (consider using IndexedDB for large,  
 *   complex data structures).  
 */

/**  
 * 8. IN-DEPTH BEST EXAMPLE:  
 *  
 * Let's build a **shopping cart** where items are temporarily stored  
 * in Session Storage (useful for guest checkouts).  
 *  
 * ```js  
 * // Retrieve cart from sessionStorage  
 * let cart = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('cart')) || [];  
 *  
 * // Add an item to the cart  
 * function addItemToCart(item) {  
 *   cart.push(item);  
 *   sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));  
 * }  
 *  
 * // Remove an item from the cart  
 * function removeItemFromCart(index) {  
 *   cart.splice(index, 1);  
 *   sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));

 *  
 * removeItemFromCart(0);  
 * console.log(JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('cart')));  
 * ```  
 *  
 * In this example:  
 * 1. Items are stored temporarily for the current session (tab).  
 * 2. If the user closes the tab, the cart will be cleared—ideal for temporary carts.  
 * 3. This ensures that **session state** is isolated and won't persist between sessions.  
 */

/**  
 * 9. WHY DOES DUPLICATING A TAB BEHAVE WEIRDLY WITH SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * - **Behavior of Duplicate Tabs**:  
 *   When you duplicate a tab (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+T), the browser creates a  
 *   new session, but **Session Storage** is sometimes copied from the original tab.  
 * - This happens because the **tab cloning process** duplicates the session data  
 *   from the original tab, which can cause unexpected behavior, especially if  
 *   you're managing session-specific states (e.g., form progress, shopping carts).  
 * - In some cases, both tabs might share the same data temporarily, but since  
 *   each tab still has **separate Session Storage**, any subsequent changes  
 *   won’t sync between them.  
 *  
 * **In-Depth Behavior Explanation**:  
 * - When a tab is cloned, browsers might **clone the session state** along  
 *   with the tab itself. This can lead to strange behavior where two tabs  
 *   seem to have the same Session Storage for a brief time.  
 * - However, as soon as any changes are made in either tab, their Session  
 *   Storage will **diverge** and behave independently.  
 * - This issue can be a problem if you're using Session Storage to track  
 *   session-based data like shopping carts or user progress.  
 * - To mitigate this, it’s best to have a **unique session identifier** for  
 *   each tab that is stored in Session Storage to avoid data collisions.  
 */

/**  
 * 10. WHAT ARE 5-6 THINGS MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT SESSION STORAGE?  
 *  
 * 1. **Scoped per tab**: Unlike Local Storage, Session Storage is scoped  
 *    to the specific tab or window, which makes it better for single-session data.  
 * 2. **Tab duplication quirks**: As mentioned, duplicating a tab can result  
 *    in Session Storage being copied temporarily, leading to unexpected results.  
 * 3. **Synchronous operation**: Just like Local Storage, Session Storage  
 *    operations block JavaScript execution. Heavy operations may slow your app.  
 * 4. **Temporary storage**: Data is deleted as soon as the tab or window  
 *    is closed, which makes it less risky than Local Storage for sensitive data.  
 * 5. **String-only storage**: Developers often overlook the fact that  
 *    you need to serialize and deserialize objects using JSON.  
 * 6. **Cross-tab isolation**: Session Storage is **isolated** between tabs,  
 *    meaning each tab has its own independent Session Storage even if  
 *    the same domain is loaded in both.  
 */

/**  
 * 11. ADVANCED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  
 *  
 * Q: What is the difference between Session Storage and Local Storage in terms of persistence?  
 * A: **Session Storage** only persists data for the lifetime of a tab or window,  
 *    meaning it is deleted as soon as the tab is closed. **Local Storage**, on the other hand,  
 *    persists data indefinitely until it is explicitly deleted by the application or the user.  
 *  
 * Q: How do you avoid duplication issues when using Session Storage in duplicated tabs?  
 * A: Use a **unique session identifier** (like a random string) in each tab,  
 *    stored in Session Storage. When a tab is duplicated, generate a new session ID,  
 *    so each tab has distinct Session Storage, even if cloned initially.  
 *  
 * Q: Can Session Storage be accessed by scripts from different domains?  
 * A: No, Session Storage is scoped by the **Same-Origin Policy**,  
 *    meaning scripts from different domains cannot access it.  
 *  
 * Q: What alternatives are there for handling temporary data across multiple tabs?  
 * A: You can use **SharedWorkers** or **BroadcastChannel API** to share  
 *    temporary state between tabs without relying on Session Storage.
