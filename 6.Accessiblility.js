/**
 *  **1. What is Web Accessibility and Why Do We Need It?**
 *  - Web accessibility ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.
 *  - This includes users with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
 *  - Accessibility goes beyond disabilities; it benefits everyone by making content easier to use, improving overall user experience.
 *  - It's a legal requirement in many countries, such as the ADA in the U.S. and the European Accessibility Act in Europe.
 *  - Accessible websites are inclusive and provide equal opportunities to all users, increasing your website's reach.
 *  - Accessibility can also improve SEO, site usability, and even performance.
 *  - It also enhances your brand image by showing that you care about every user and their experience, which can lead to better engagement.
 *
 *  **2. What is WCAG 2?**
 *  - WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of standards developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) for ensuring web accessibility.
 *  - The guidelines are organized around four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (often referred to as the POUR model).
 *  - Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive all information and content, such as images having alt text for screen readers.
 *  - Operable: The interface must be operable by all users, for instance, making sure everything can be navigated via keyboard alone.
 *  - Understandable: The content and interface should be easy to understand for all users, including clear instructions and error recovery.
 *  - Robust: The content must be compatible with assistive technologies and future updates in web standards.
 *  - WCAG 2.0 is technology-independent, meaning it applies to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among other technologies.
 *  - There are 12 guidelines in total, and they have different levels of conformance (A, AA, AAA), which represent increasing levels of accessibility.
 *
 *  **3. What are Assistive Technologies and What Types Exist?**
 *  - Assistive technologies are devices, software, or equipment that help individuals with disabilities navigate and interact with digital content.
 *  - Common assistive technologies include screen readers, braille displays, screen magnifiers, and voice recognition software.
 *  - Screen readers, such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver, convert text to speech or braille, helping visually impaired users navigate a website.
 *  - Screen magnifiers, such as ZoomText, enlarge portions of the screen for users with low vision.
 *  - Speech recognition software, like Dragon NaturallySpeaking, helps users control their computer with their voice instead of a keyboard or mouse.
 *  - Some users rely on eye-tracking systems or adaptive keyboards, especially those with mobility issues.
 *  - Web developers must ensure compatibility with these technologies by using proper semantic HTML, labeling elements, and providing keyboard-friendly navigation.
 *
 *  **4. What Are the Different Levels of Conformance (A, AA, AAA) in WCAG 2?**
 *  - WCAG defines three levels of conformance to accommodate varying levels of accessibility: A, AA, and AAA.
 *  - **Level A (Minimum Level):** The lowest level of accessibility, covering basic needs. If not met, the site is largely unusable for people with disabilities.
 *    - Examples: Provide text alternatives for non-text content, ensure keyboard navigation, and avoid using content that causes seizures.
 *  - **Level AA (Mid Level):** This is often the legal requirement in many countries. It ensures a broader and more user-friendly experience for people with disabilities.
 *    - Examples: Ensure contrast ratios are sufficient, make text resizable, and offer navigation aids like skip links.
 *  - **Level AAA (Highest Level):** The most inclusive standard, which makes content accessible to the broadest range of disabilities. It is ideal but often harder to achieve.
 *    - Examples: No time limits for reading content, ensuring a reading level suitable for the general public, and providing sign language interpretation for audio content.
 *  - The goal is to progressively move from Level A compliance to AA, and for more inclusive designs, AAA.
 *
 *  **5. What is WebAIM?**
 *  - WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) is a non-profit organization that focuses on empowering individuals and organizations to make web content accessible.
 *  - They provide educational resources, tools, and consulting services to help web developers and businesses achieve better accessibility.
 *  - WebAIM also produces tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker and WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), which help developers identify accessibility issues in their web pages.
 *  - They conduct research into accessibility practices and guidelines, offering reports on the current state of web accessibility.
 *  - Their resources help explain how to meet WCAG standards and make websites more inclusive for people with disabilities.
 *  - WebAIM is known for offering comprehensive guidelines and step-by-step solutions for fixing accessibility problems.
 *
 *  **6. Different Accessibility Standards?**
 *  - Apart from WCAG, there are several accessibility standards globally, with similar goals of ensuring digital content is accessible to everyone.
 *  - **Section 508 (U.S.):** This is part of the Rehabilitation Act in the United States that mandates that all federal websites and electronic communications be accessible to individuals with disabilities.
 *  - **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act):** Though initially for physical spaces, it has been extended to include websites, ensuring equal access to goods and services.
 *  - **EN 301 549 (Europe):** This is the accessibility standard in the EU, which references WCAG 2.1, and requires that public sector websites and mobile apps be accessible.
 *  - **AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act):** A Canadian law that mandates digital accessibility for public and private organizations within Ontario.
 *  - **ISO 9241-171:** A global standard focused on the ergonomics of human-system interaction, it emphasizes accessibility for interactive systems.
 *  - These standards often build upon WCAG guidelines, but they include additional legal and regional requirements.

                                /** SCREEN READER */

                              
/**
 *  **1. What is a Screen Reader? How Does It Help in Accessibility?**
 *  - A screen reader is an assistive technology that reads the content on a screen aloud or outputs it to a braille device, enabling users with visual impairments or blindness to navigate websites and interact with digital content.
 *  - It works by parsing the HTML of a webpage and conveying its structure to the user, allowing them to understand headings, links, images, forms, and dynamic elements.
 *  - Screen readers rely heavily on the semantics of the HTML document to convey meaning, so poorly structured or improperly labeled content can be confusing.
 *  - The role of the screen reader is essential in providing access to the digital world for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to use websites effectively.
 *  - Popular screen readers include **JAWS** (Job Access With Speech) for Windows, **NVDA** (Non-Visual Desktop Access), **VoiceOver** for macOS/iOS, and **TalkBack** for Android.
 *  - For accessibility, developers must ensure their websites are built in a way that these tools can interpret them easily, which involves using proper HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and ensuring interactive content is accessible through the keyboard.
 *  - By ensuring screen reader compatibility, developers can expand their audience and comply with legal regulations such as the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** and the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**.

 *  **2. Is It the Developer's Job to Make Sure Screen Readers Understand Their Web Page?**
 *  - Yes, it is absolutely the developer's responsibility to ensure their website is accessible, including making sure it works properly with screen readers.
 *  - To do this, developers need to write semantic HTML, meaning they must use the correct HTML elements to describe the content. For instance, using `<button>` for clickable buttons rather than `<div>` elements with JavaScript handlers.
 *  - Developers should also use **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** roles and attributes when necessary, to give additional context to screen readers about complex UI elements such as sliders, tabs, or modals.
 *  - One of the most important aspects of screen reader compatibility is making sure the website is **keyboard accessible**, meaning all interactive elements can be navigated using just the keyboard. This is critical because many screen reader users rely on keyboard navigation.
 *  - Failing to make a site accessible can exclude a significant number of users and can also have legal repercussions. Additionally, search engines like Google also favor accessible websites, making this important from an SEO standpoint as well.

 *  **3. Best JS Example That Has 0% Accessibility vs One With 100% Accessibility**
 *  
 *  // Example with 0% Accessibility
 *  ```
 *  <div onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>  // The div is not semantically correct for a button
 *  <input type="text" placeholder="Your Email">  // No label for the input field
 *  ```
 *  - In this example, using a `<div>` for the submit button is not accessible because screen readers don’t recognize it as a button, and users who navigate via keyboard cannot interact with it properly. The input field also lacks a label, so screen readers will have difficulty identifying its purpose.

 *  // Example with 100% Accessibility
 *  ```
 *  <button type="submit">Submit</button>  // A semantically correct button element
 *  <label for="email">Email</label>
 *  <input type="email" id="email">
 *  ```
 *  - In this improved example, the button is correctly defined with a `<button>` tag, which screen readers will identify as interactive, and the input field has a descriptive label, helping users understand its purpose. 

 *  **4. Why Do We Say HTML5 Semantics Help in Accessibility by Default?**
 *  - HTML5 introduced several semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`, which provide inherent meaning to the content they enclose.
 *  - These elements help screen readers by giving them predefined roles and context about the content structure, allowing users to navigate through different sections of a page more effectively.
 *  - For example, a screen reader can announce that the user is inside a `<nav>` element, indicating the user is in the navigation area of the page, or inside a `<main>` tag, indicating this is the core content.
 *  - Additionally, elements like `<section>` or `<article>` are helpful in organizing content hierarchically, which assists users in understanding the logical flow of the webpage.
 *  - Developers don’t need to add extra ARIA roles to these elements as screen readers already understand their meaning. However, if complex custom elements are used, ARIA roles and labels might be necessary to describe their functionality.
 *  - Semantic HTML not only benefits screen reader users but also enhances **SEO** because search engines use these elements to better understand and index page content.

 *  **5. List of All HTML5 Semantics That Help in Accessibility (With Examples)**
 *  - **<header>:** Defines introductory content, usually a group of navigational links or a title. Helps screen readers identify the start of the page or section.
 *    Example: 
 *    ```
 *    <header> <h1>Website Title</h1> <nav>...</nav> </header>
 *    ```
 *  - **<nav>:** Specifies a navigation section with links. It helps screen readers announce this as a navigational region.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <nav> <a href="/home">Home</a> <a href="/about">About</a> </nav>
 *    ```
 *  - **<main>:** Contains the main content of the webpage, signaling to screen readers where the primary information resides.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <main> <h1>Main Content</h1> <p>Article Body...</p> </main>
 *    ```
 *  - **<article>:** Represents independent, self-contained content like a blog post or a news article. Screen readers will announce this as distinct content.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <article> <h2>Blog Post Title</h2> <p>Blog content here...</p> </article>
 *    ```
 *  - **<section>:** Defines a section within a document, often with its own heading. Screen readers treat this as a distinct segment of the page.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <section> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Introduction content...</p> </section>
 *    ```
 *  - **<footer>:** Marks the end or footer area of the page, often containing links to legal information, privacy policies, etc.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <footer> <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> </footer>
 *    ```
 *  - **<aside>:** Used for content tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars. It helps differentiate between core and auxiliary content.
 *    Example:
 *    ```
 *    <aside> <h3>Related Links</h3> <ul><li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li></ul> </aside>
 *    ```
 *  - These HTML5 semantic elements help provide a clear structure and hierarchy for both users and assistive technologies like screen readers, improving accessibility and usability for all.

/**
 *   NOW SEE WE KNOW THAT HTML SMNYTICS HELP USE BUT NOT 100% SO THAT WHY WE HAVE ARIA 
 *   I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT ARIA TRY 8 DIFFERENT IN DEPTH QUESTION
 */

/**
 *   **1. What is ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)? Why Do We Need It?**
 *   - ARIA stands for **Accessible Rich Internet Applications**, a set of attributes that developers can add to HTML elements to enhance accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies, like screen readers.
 *   - HTML5 semantics help a lot in accessibility by defining the structure of a page, but ARIA goes further by giving additional meaning to dynamic, interactive elements (e.g., sliders, modals, accordions) that native HTML elements cannot describe fully.
 *   - For example, if you're creating a custom dropdown menu or a tab system using `<div>` or `<span>`, ARIA attributes can specify the role, state, and behavior of those elements for screen readers, ensuring accessibility.
 *   - ARIA helps bridge the gap between modern, complex web interfaces and assistive technologies, making rich content accessible to users with disabilities.
 *   - We need ARIA in scenarios where native HTML elements can't fully communicate a UI element's role or state to screen readers, especially for custom components.
 *   
 *   **2. How to Use ARIA? (Common ARIA Roles and Attributes)**
 *   - ARIA provides three primary categories of attributes: **roles**, **states**, and **properties**.
 *   - **Roles:** Define what kind of UI element a particular HTML element is. For example:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="button">Click me</div>  // Defining a div as a button
 *     ```
 *   - **States:** Indicate the current state of an interactive element. For example, a toggle switch can have an `aria-checked` state:
 *     ```
 *     <button aria-checked="true">Toggle</button>
 *     ```
 *   - **Properties:** Provide additional information about elements. For instance, `aria-label` provides an accessible name to screen readers:
 *     ```
 *     <button aria-label="Submit the form">Submit</button>
 *     ```
 *   - These attributes are crucial when native HTML elements don't suffice for describing custom UI components and interactions to assistive technologies.

 *   **3. When Should You Use ARIA?**
 *   - ARIA should be used sparingly, primarily for non-semantic, custom elements that lack native accessibility support.
 *   - A good rule of thumb is to always prefer native HTML elements (like `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc.) over divs or spans with ARIA roles and attributes because native elements already come with built-in accessibility.
 *   - You should use ARIA when you're building custom widgets (like tabs, accordions, and sliders) or non-standard interactions that need to communicate their role, state, or behavior to screen readers.
 *   - For example, if you create a custom dropdown with `<div>`, you would use ARIA to indicate which element is expanded or collapsed with `aria-expanded`, and which is currently selected with `aria-selected`.
 *   - Use ARIA when native elements can't fully express the functionality or interaction model you want to implement.

 *   **4. When Should You NOT Use ARIA?**
 *   - Avoid using ARIA when semantic HTML already provides sufficient accessibility. For example:
 *     - Don't use `role="button"` on an element that is already a `<button>`.
 *     - Avoid adding ARIA attributes to elements that have clear native roles, like forms, links, or lists.
 *   - Overusing ARIA can lead to accessibility issues if misapplied, and it can confuse users of assistive technologies.
 *   - Another critical point: ARIA does not make elements **focusable** by default. You still need to ensure keyboard accessibility (e.g., adding `tabindex` or native controls).
 *   - ARIA should never be a replacement for proper HTML, CSS, or JavaScript; it's an enhancement for accessibility but cannot fix bad code.

 *   **5. What Are Some Key ARIA Properties and Roles Used Day-to-Day?**
 *   - **role="alert"**: This role is used for dynamic content updates that need to be announced by screen readers immediately.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="alert">Error: Please fill out this field.</div>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-hidden="true"**: Hides an element from screen readers without affecting visual display. Commonly used for hiding decorative icons or elements that shouldn’t be announced.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <i class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-live**: Announces dynamic changes on a webpage, such as form validation messages or content loaded via AJAX.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div aria-live="polite">New message received.</div>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-expanded**: Indicates the expanded or collapsed state of a collapsible section, accordion, or dropdown.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <button aria-expanded="false">Toggle Content</button>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-controls**: Identifies another element that is controlled by the current one. For example, a tab controlling the content panel.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <button aria-controls="panel1">Open Panel</button>
 *     <div id="panel1" role="region">Panel content here...</div>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-label**: Provides an accessible name or label to an element when the text is not visible.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <button aria-label="Close the dialog">X</button>
 *     ```

 *   **6. What Are ARIA Live Regions and Why Are They Important?**
 *   - **ARIA live regions** are sections of the page that are automatically announced by screen readers when their content changes. They are especially important for notifying users about dynamic content like chat messages, form validation, or real-time updates without requiring the user to manually navigate.
 *   - The `aria-live` property can be set to "polite," "assertive," or "off" depending on how urgently the information needs to be conveyed to the user.
 *   - Example of a live region with "polite" announcement:
 *     ```
 *     <div aria-live="polite">Your cart has been updated.</div>
 *     ```
 *   - Live regions ensure that users with disabilities are informed of important changes on the page without losing context or needing to interact manually with the interface.

 *   **7. What Are Some ARIA Attributes That 99% of Developers Don't Know About?**
 *   - **aria-flowto**: Allows users to navigate to a different part of the document using screen readers in a sequential manner, helping them follow content that is not linear.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div id="step1" aria-flowto="step3">Step 1</div>
 *     <div id="step2">Step 2</div>
 *     <div id="step3">Step 3</div>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-roledescription**: Allows developers to provide a custom role description for an element, which screen readers will announce instead of the default role.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="button" aria-roledescription="Submit Form">Submit</div>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-current**: Used to indicate the current item in a list of items, such as the current page in a navigation menu.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <li aria-current="page">Home</li>
 *     ```
 *   - **aria-modal**: Helps assistive technology understand that the content inside a dialog or modal is separate and should be treated as such.
 *     Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="dialog" aria-modal="true">Modal Content</div>
 *     ```

 *   **8. How to Avoid Common Mistakes While Using ARIA?**
 *   - One common mistake is using ARIA roles or attributes on elements where they aren't needed, such as adding `role="button"` to a `<button>` element or using `aria-label` on an already labeled form element.
 *   - Another mistake is not ensuring proper keyboard navigation. For instance, just adding ARIA attributes without `tabindex` won’t make a custom control focusable.
 *   - Failing to test the site with a screen reader to verify that ARIA attributes are working as intended is another significant mistake.
 *   - Over-reliance on ARIA without addressing fundamental HTML and CSS accessibility issues can make a site less accessible in practice.
 *   - Ensure ARIA properties are dynamic where necessary, especially states like `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-checked`—these should change in response to user interaction.

// FEW MORE THINK ABOUT ARIA

/**
 *   **1. What is ARIA-Live?**
 *   - **ARIA-Live** is an attribute used to announce dynamic updates to users of assistive technologies (like screen readers) without them having to manually navigate to the changed content.
 *   - It is critical for making changes in content accessible, particularly in web apps where updates happen without a full page reload (e.g., chats, notifications, form validation).
 *   - ARIA-live can have three values:
 *     - **"off"**: No live updates are announced.
 *     - **"polite"**: Changes are announced when the user is idle or finishes their current task.
 *     - **"assertive"**: The update is announced immediately, interrupting the current task the user is engaged in.
 *   - Example:
 *     ```
 *     <div aria-live="polite">Your message was sent successfully.</div>
 *     ```
 *   - Use ARIA-live for situations where you have dynamically updated content that users need to be aware of, such as a notification after submitting a form.

 *   **2. What Are ARIA Roles?**
 *   - ARIA roles define the purpose of an element, communicating its functionality to assistive technologies.
 *   - For example, if you're using a `<div>` or `<span>` to create a custom button, you can define its role using ARIA to inform screen readers that this element behaves like a button:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="button" tabindex="0">Click me</div>
 *     ```
 *   - Types of ARIA roles include:
 *     - **Widget roles**: Interactive elements (e.g., `button`, `slider`, `checkbox`).
 *     - **Document structure roles**: Define how different parts of a document are structured (e.g., `main`, `article`, `navigation`).
 *     - **Landmark roles**: Define high-level regions of the page (e.g., `banner`, `navigation`, `contentinfo`).
 *   - Use roles when creating non-standard UI elements that don't have a default semantic meaning (e.g., custom sliders, tabs, modals).

 *   **3. What Are ARIA States?**
 *   - ARIA states describe the **current condition** of an interactive element, especially when its state is dynamic and changes based on user interaction.
 *   - States include:
 *     - **aria-checked**: Used with elements like checkboxes to describe whether they are checked or not.
 *       ```
 *       <input type="checkbox" aria-checked="true"> Accept Terms
 *       ```
 *     - **aria-expanded**: Describes whether a collapsible section or dropdown is open.
 *       ```
 *       <button aria-expanded="false">Expand Content</button>
 *       ```
 *     - **aria-disabled**: Indicates that an element is disabled and cannot be interacted with.
 *       ```
 *       <button aria-disabled="true">Submit</button>
 *       ```
 *   - Use ARIA states when you need to describe the dynamic behavior of an element in real-time, ensuring that assistive technologies are aware of state changes.

 *   **4. What Are ARIA Properties?**
 *   - ARIA properties provide additional details about an element that assistive technologies can interpret.
 *   - These properties describe relationships or provide supplementary information. Examples include:
 *     - **aria-label**: Provides an accessible name for an element, useful for icons or elements without visible text.
 *       ```
 *       <button aria-label="Save Document">Save</button>
 *       ```
 *     - **aria-labelledby**: Links the current element to another element that provides a label.
 *       ```
 *       <button aria-labelledby="heading1">Submit</button>
 *       <h1 id="heading1">Submit Form</h1>
 *       ```
 *     - **aria-describedby**: Provides a reference to additional explanatory content.
 *       ```
 *       <button aria-describedby="info">Help</button>
 *       <p id="info">Clicking this will open a help dialog.</p>
 *       ```
 *   - Use ARIA properties to give elements additional accessibility context that isn't present in the standard HTML structure, especially for complex or custom components.

 *   **5. What Is ARIA Type?**
 *   - **ARIA Types** refer to the classification of ARIA attributes based on the kind of value they can take.
 *   - ARIA attributes can be:
 *     - **Boolean** (e.g., `aria-checked`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`), which is either `true` or `false`.
 *     - **Tristate** (e.g., `aria-checked`), which can have `true`, `false`, or `mixed` values for partially checked states.
 *     - **Token** (e.g., `aria-live`), which can take a list of predefined values (e.g., `"polite"`, `"assertive"`, `"off"`).
 *     - **String** (e.g., `aria-label`), which allows a custom text string.
 *   - When defining ARIA attributes, it’s important to follow the expected type to ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret the attribute.

 *   **6. When Should You Use ARIA Roles, States, and Properties?**
 *   - Use **roles** when an element needs to communicate its function but lacks a semantic HTML counterpart (e.g., custom buttons, sliders).
 *   - Use **states** when an element’s behavior or appearance can change dynamically (e.g., toggling a collapsible menu, enabling/disabling form elements).
 *   - Use **properties** when additional context or relationships between elements need to be clarified (e.g., linking labels to form controls, describing additional help text for a button).
 *   - For example, a custom dropdown built with `<div>` elements would use `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and possibly `aria-labelledby` to fully convey its function and state to assistive technologies.

 *   **7. When Should You NOT Use ARIA?**
 *   - Avoid ARIA when semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<form>`, `<input>`) provide built-in accessibility.
 *   - Don’t use ARIA as a substitute for missing HTML functionality. For example, adding `role="button"` to a div is less effective than just using a `<button>`.
 *   - Overusing ARIA attributes can clutter the accessibility tree and confuse users of assistive technologies.
 *   - Always prefer native HTML elements over custom widgets with ARIA when possible because native elements have built-in accessibility behaviors that ARIA attempts to replicate.

 *   **8. Practical Example Combining ARIA Roles, States, and Properties**
 *   - Here’s an example of a custom accordion using ARIA roles, states, and properties:
 *     ```
 *     <div role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="section1" tabindex="0">
 *       Toggle Section 1
 *     </div>
 *     <div id="section1" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
 *       <p>Accordion content here...</p>
 *     </div>
 *     ```
 *   - In this example:
 *     - The `div` has the role of `button` to indicate that it behaves like a button.
 *     - `aria-expanded` tells the screen reader whether the accordion is open or closed.
 *     - `aria-controls` links the button to the content it controls.
 *     - The content section has `aria-hidden="true"` to ensure it's hidden from screen readers when collapsed.
 *   - By using ARIA attributes appropriately, we ensure that both keyboard users and screen reader users have full access to the functionality.

                                              /** ACCESIBLITY TREE */


  /**
 *   **What is the Accessibility Tree? (In-Depth Explanation)**
 *   
 *   - The **Accessibility Tree** is an abstraction layer between the DOM (Document Object Model) and assistive technologies (like screen readers). 
 *   - It is automatically generated by the browser and is a subset of the DOM, containing only the elements that are relevant for assistive technologies. 
 *   - The accessibility tree represents how the content will be presented to users with disabilities, ensuring that they can interact with the page.
 *   - This tree is structured similarly to the DOM but filtered to show only the essential content such as text, roles, states, and properties.

 *   **How is the Accessibility Tree Generated?**
 *   - The browser analyzes the web page’s DOM and automatically generates the accessibility tree by interpreting the HTML, CSS, and ARIA attributes.
 *   - Native HTML elements like `<button>`, `<input>`, `<form>` automatically contribute to the tree because of their semantic roles.
 *   - The accessibility tree is influenced by:
 *     - **HTML semantics**: Tags like `<h1>`, `<nav>`, `<article>` are automatically added to the tree as they have clear roles.
 *     - **ARIA roles, states, and properties**: These provide extra information or override default behaviors for custom elements.
 *     - **CSS display and visibility**: Elements with `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` are excluded from the tree.
 *     - **tabindex**: Elements with a `tabindex` attribute can become keyboard-navigable and affect the focus order.

 *   **How is the Accessibility Tree Used by Assistive Technologies?**
 *   - Screen readers and other assistive technologies use the accessibility tree to determine what should be announced or focused on.
 *   - The tree abstracts irrelevant elements like decorative images or layout-based `<div>` containers that don’t carry useful information for users.
 *   - For example, screen readers rely on the tree to announce form labels, button actions, and headings in a structured and accessible manner.
 *   - The tree also provides context, such as hierarchical relationships between elements (e.g., which buttons are within which sections).

 *   **Components of the Accessibility Tree**
 *   - **Node Role**: Each node in the tree has a role (e.g., button, checkbox, slider). This is derived from the HTML element or set explicitly with ARIA roles.
 *     - Example: A `<button>` element’s role is automatically interpreted as a "button."
 *   - **Node Name**: The accessible name of the element, which is either inferred from text content or set using attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
 *     - Example: A button with the text “Submit” would have "Submit" as its accessible name.
 *   - **Node Value**: The current value of a form element or control, such as the checked state of a checkbox (`true`, `false`, or `mixed`).
 *   - **Node States and Properties**: These represent the current state (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, `aria-disabled`) and properties (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`).
 *   - **Hierarchy and Relationships**: The accessibility tree maintains the hierarchical relationship between elements (parent-child relationships) and other linked elements using ARIA properties like `aria-controls` or `aria-labelledby`.

 *   **Differences Between the DOM and Accessibility Tree**
 *   - Not every DOM element appears in the accessibility tree. Elements like `<div>` and `<span>` without ARIA roles are typically ignored unless they contain meaningful content or are interactive.
 *   - **Hidden elements**: DOM elements that are hidden with `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` are not included in the accessibility tree.
 *   - **ARIA overrides**: Elements can have their default roles or properties overridden using ARIA attributes (e.g., using `role="button"` on a `<div>`). These overrides are respected in the accessibility tree.

 *   **Common Issues with Accessibility Trees**
 *   - **Incorrect or missing roles**: If elements lack appropriate roles (e.g., custom buttons without `role="button"`), they may be excluded or misrepresented in the tree, leading to poor accessibility.
 *   - **Misuse of ARIA**: Overuse or incorrect use of ARIA attributes can clutter the tree, making it harder for assistive technologies to interpret the content.
 *   - **Focus issues**: If the focus order is not managed correctly (e.g., using `tabindex` improperly), the accessibility tree may present a confusing navigation experience for keyboard and screen reader users.
 *   - **Hidden content confusion**: Developers sometimes hide important content visually using CSS, but don’t remove it from the accessibility tree, leading to unnecessary announcements by screen readers.

 *   **How to Inspect the Accessibility Tree**
 *   - Modern browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) allow you to inspect the accessibility tree directly.
 *     - **In Chrome**: You can open the developer tools, navigate to the “Elements” tab, and find the “Accessibility” pane for any selected element to see how it appears in the accessibility tree.
 *     - **In Firefox**: Open developer tools, select the “Accessibility” tab, and explore the accessibility tree structure.
 *   - Using these tools, developers can verify how assistive technologies will interpret and interact with their page, ensuring that important elements are correctly represented in the tree.
 *   - This can help you catch potential accessibility issues early in the development process.

 *   **Example: Accessible vs Inaccessible Element**
 *     ```
 *     <!-- Inaccessible button using <div> without ARIA -->
 *     <div>Submit</div>

 *     <!-- Accessible button using <button> -->
 *     <button>Submit</button>

 *     <!-- Accessible custom button using ARIA -->
 *     <div role="button" tabindex="0">Submit</div>
 *     ```
 *   - In the first case, the `<div>` will not appear in the accessibility tree unless it is explicitly marked with a role, making it invisible to screen readers.
 *   - The native `<button>` will automatically appear in the tree with a "button" role.
 *   - In the third example, using `role="button"` ensures that the `<div>` is treated as a button by assistive technologies.

 *   **Why Does the Accessibility Tree Matter?**
 *   - The accessibility tree is crucial because it determines how accessible your site is to users who rely on assistive technologies.
 *   - By understanding and working with the accessibility tree, developers can create inclusive experiences that accommodate all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.
 *   - Without a well-structured tree, users may miss critical functionality, such as form submissions or navigation, making the site unusable for them.
 *   - In summary, paying attention to the accessibility tree ensures that your application is accessible, usable, and compliant with web accessibility standards.
