   *   JEST
   *   React testing library
   *   Jsdom
   *   How can we do full setup from zero when we are using parcel
   *   babel.rc
   *   react-preset for JSX
   *   test("description",() => {})
   *   it("description",() => {})
   *   describe("suite description", () =>)
   *   render()
   *   screen.getByText()
   *   expect(); // Assertion
   *   Most cases try to attech data-testid rether then using getByText, getByRole etc.
   *   getAllBytext , getAllByRole
   *   toBeinDocument(); // from jsdom
   *   fireEvent.click();
   *   fireEvent.onChang();
   *   unit testing
   *   integration testing
   *   jsdom does not understanding routers or stores so make sure you wrap your component with those
   *   act() when using states or any asyc operation wrap your component with it
   *   mock data
   *   also jsdom does not understand fetch and all we need to mock that also
   *   global.fetch = jest.fn(); mock fetch inside this
   *   testing library is core of all other library in case of testing
   *   rerender()
