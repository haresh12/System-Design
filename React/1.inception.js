/** 
 *   WHY DO WE NEED REACT IF WE ALREADY HAVE HTML, CSS, AND JS?
 * 
 *   - HTML, CSS, and JS are great for static, small websites.
 *   - React simplifies the creation of dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
 *   - It introduces the concept of *components*, which allows you to reuse code.
 *   - React automatically updates (re-renders) the UI when data changes.
 *   - It makes managing *state* in large, complex apps much easier.
 *   - React ensures faster rendering by using a *Virtual DOM* for diffing.
 *   - Development with React is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
 */

/** 
 *   WHAT DOES REACT MAKE EASY OR DIFFERENTLY IN THE PROCESS?
 *   
 *   - React breaks the UI into independent, reusable components.
 *   - Updates to components are efficient with the *Virtual DOM*, 
 *     which calculates minimal updates to the real DOM.
 *   - JSX allows writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.
 *   - React encourages a *declarative* approach; you define what the UI should look like, 
 *     and React takes care of updating it based on state changes.
 *   - It promotes *unidirectional data flow*, reducing complexity in large apps.
 */

/** 
 *   WHAT IS CDN? IS IT A GOOD OPTION TO GET REACT FROM CDN OR NODE MODULES?
 * 
 *   - CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed server network to deliver 
 *     content quickly to users.
 *   - Using React via CDN is great for quick prototypes or lightweight apps 
 *     where you don't need to bundle all dependencies.
 *   - Node modules (npm) are better for larger, production-level apps as 
 *     they allow local control over versions, optimizations, and bundling.
 *   - NPM allows better development experience, local testing, and environment-specific builds.
 */

/** 
 *   WHAT IS NPM?
 *   
 *   - NPM (Node Package Manager) is a tool for managing JavaScript packages.
 *   - It helps developers install, share, and maintain JavaScript libraries or tools.
 *   - In React, npm is used to install dependencies like React, Webpack, Babel, etc.
 *   - With npm, you can lock versions of libraries to ensure consistent behavior across environments.
 */

/** 
 *   IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF REACT.CREATEELEMENT() AND REACTDOM.CREATEROOT()
 *   
 *   - React.createElement(): 
 *     - This is the core API of React to create a virtual DOM element.
 *     - Takes three arguments: 
 *       1. The element type (like 'div', 'h1', or a custom component)
 *       2. Props (attributes like className, id, etc.)
 *       3. Children (text or other React elements)
 *     - Example: React.createElement('div', { className: 'container' }, 'Hello World')
 *     - Behind the scenes, JSX is just a syntactic sugar for createElement().
 *   
 *   - ReactDOM.createRoot():
 *     - This is used to create a root node in React 18+ to enable *concurrent rendering*.
 *     - ReactDOM.createRoot() replaces the older ReactDOM.render() in newer versions.
 *     - It provides better performance, non-blocking rendering, and allows more granular updates.
 */

/** 
 *   IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION OF THE render() METHOD: 
 *   
 *   - The render method in React is responsible for rendering the virtual DOM into the actual DOM.
 *   - It converts JSX or React.createElement() objects into DOM nodes.
 *   - The render method can be part of functional components (via hooks like useEffect) or class components.
 *   - In older versions (React 17 and below):
 *     - ReactDOM.render(component, DOMNode) was used.
 *   - In React 18+:
 *     - You create a root node with ReactDOM.createRoot() and then call root.render().
 *   - Process:
 *     1. Virtual DOM is created with React.createElement() or JSX.
 *     2. React checks the difference between the previous and current virtual DOM.
 *     3. Only the changed parts (diffing) are updated in the real DOM (thanks to Virtual DOM).
 *     4. This is faster and more efficient than updating the DOM directly.
 *   - This ensures a smooth, efficient user interface even with frequent updates.
 * 
 *   
 *   WHAT DO WE MEAN BY UNI-DIRECTIONAL DATA FLOW?
 *   
 *   - In React, data flows in one direction: from *parent* components to *child* components.
 *   - This means state is always passed down through props from parent to child.
 *   - Child components cannot modify parent state directly, ensuring better control over data flow.
 *   - Unidirectional flow makes debugging easier as you can trace where data came from.
 *   - It contrasts with two-way binding where changes in UI can directly affect state, leading to more complex state management.
 *   - React's unidirectional data flow makes it predictable and easier to reason about.

/**
 *   THINGS THAT 99% OF DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT REACT.CREATEELEMENT, REACTDOM.CREATEROOT, AND render() METHOD?
 *   
 *   - React.createElement():
 *     - Most developers think JSX is "React," but it's syntactic sugar for React.createElement().
 *     - React.createElement is essential for understanding how React works under the hood.
 *     - Developers often don't realize that using React.createElement makes React more flexible 
 *       (it can be used without JSX, but it's less readable).
 *   
 *   - ReactDOM.createRoot():
 *     - It was introduced in React 18 and is often misunderstood.
 *     - It enables *concurrent rendering*—allowing React to pause, interrupt, or resume rendering tasks for better performance.
 *     - Many developers don’t realize the performance benefits and continue to use ReactDOM.render().
 *   
 *   - render() method:
 *     - Developers assume render just dumps everything to the DOM, but it’s part of a sophisticated *reconciliation* process.
 *     - The render method uses a diffing algorithm to compare the virtual DOM and only updates the real DOM where necessary.
 *     - Many developers are unaware that the *Virtual DOM* is an in-memory representation of the real DOM that speeds up updates.
 */

/**
 *   WHY DO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT LIBRARIES, ONE FOR REACT AND ONE FOR REACTDOM?
 *   
 *   - React (react package):
 *     - React is responsible for creating and managing the component tree and the virtual DOM.
 *     - It works independently of the actual rendering platform (DOM, mobile, etc.).
 *     - React is platform-agnostic, which is why it powers things like React Native (for mobile apps).
 *   
 *   - ReactDOM (react-dom package):
 *     - ReactDOM is specific to web platforms and is used to render React components into the actual DOM.
 *     - ReactDOM handles how the virtual DOM (created by React) maps to the real DOM in the browser.
 *     - By splitting React and ReactDOM, it becomes easier to port React to other platforms, 
 *       like React Native, which uses *React* without *ReactDOM*.
 */

/**
 *   WHEN USING CDN FOR REACT, WHY DO WE HAVE TO PASS crossorigin? IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION
 *   
 *   - The `crossorigin` attribute is needed when loading resources like React from an external CDN.
 *   - It controls how the browser handles requests for external resources and what information is shared between the server and client.
 *   - The most common values for `crossorigin` are:
 *     1. `anonymous`: No credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) are sent with the request.
 *     2. `use-credentials`: Credentials (like cookies or authentication headers) are included in the request.
 *   
 *   - Why use `crossorigin` with React CDN?
 *     - When loading React via a CDN, `crossorigin` ensures that the resource can be shared between different origins (websites).
 *     - Without `crossorigin`, loading assets from another domain might fail due to *CORS* (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.
 *     - For security reasons, browsers block certain types of cross-origin requests unless explicitly allowed using `crossorigin`.
 *     - If the resource (React from CDN) triggers any errors or fetches from another origin, 
 *       the error won't be reported unless crossorigin is properly configured.
 *     - It’s important when the browser requests external resources to prevent issues with error reporting and debugging.

/**
 *  15 MOST ADVANCED POINTS
 * 
 *  1. React.createElement() is the core API used behind the scenes in JSX and can be used without JSX,
 *     making React flexible to use in non-JSX environments.
 * 
 *  2. JSX is not HTML, it's syntactic sugar for React.createElement(), and understanding this 
 *     allows for better debugging of compiled code.
 * 
 *  3. ReactDOM.createRoot() enables concurrent rendering, which allows React to pause, 
 *     interrupt, and resume rendering based on task priority, improving performance for complex apps.
 * 
 *  4. ReactDOM.createRoot() in React 18+ provides finer control over rendering, 
 *     including suspending rendering if needed, making UI interactions smoother.
 * 
 *  5. React's *Virtual DOM* is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. 
 *     It minimizes expensive DOM manipulations by batching updates and only re-rendering changed parts.
 * 
 *  6. React's render method doesn’t just render UI; it triggers a process called *reconciliation*, 
 *     where React calculates the minimal changes required and updates only the necessary DOM nodes.
 * 
 *  7. Unidirectional data flow in React means that all data flows from parent components down to children. 
 *     This creates more predictable and easier-to-debug applications, unlike two-way data binding.
 * 
 *  8. Most developers don't know that you can pass an updater function to React's setState() in class components, 
 *     which is crucial for handling state changes when multiple state updates happen in quick succession.
 * 
 *  9. React components re-render based on state or prop changes. But developers often don’t realize 
 *     that React uses *referential equality* to determine if a re-render is needed.
 * 
 *  10. React is platform-agnostic: React Native uses the same React library (without ReactDOM) 
 *      to create mobile apps, while ReactDOM is specific to web platforms.
 * 
 *  11. React doesn't just update the UI when data changes; it *schedules* updates in a non-blocking manner, 
 *      allowing it to prioritize critical tasks over less important updates.
 * 
 *  12. The `crossorigin` attribute is critical when loading React from a CDN, 
 *      as it controls how resources are fetched across different origins, preventing potential CORS issues.
 * 
 *  13. React.createElement() returns a plain JavaScript object describing the element. 
 *      It contains type, props, and children, and React uses it to build the virtual DOM tree.
 * 
 *  14. React can batch state updates within event handlers, meaning that multiple state updates 
 *      will only trigger one re-render, significantly improving performance.
 * 
 *  15. React's default behavior of shallow comparison in PureComponent and React.memo 
 *      can lead to performance issues if not used carefully, particularly with nested objects or arrays.
