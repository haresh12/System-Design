/**
 *   In this module we don't have any practical's to cover but this module will cover about different logging tools why those are
 *   importent and how do you test application when it's in production
 * 
 *   Why user logs matters and when you are logging details how importent it is to care about different GDPA , HIPPA and PIA all this
 *   guidline's regarding user information
 * 
 *   Tools that we are going to cover
 * 
 *    Google Analytics
 *    Microsoft Clearity (This is lit)
 *    LogRocket
 *    Syntry 
 *    Open Telemetry
 *    
 * 
 *  Now above all tools will give you information about user events and we can add our custom events also
 * 
 *  But after Logging next importent step would be Alearting which helps us when something critical happens
 *  or something passed some threshold this is lit and even in tools like Syntry offers us the 
 *  alerting system our SMS , EMAIL SLACK AND ONCALL ALSO . ONCALL IS LIT
 * 
 *  Next after alerting and logging last step is fixing see its always upto criticality of bug like how seviour it
 *  is in my career i have done lot's of hot fixes also and 80% case we just log the bug in JIRA and then 
 *  set  version for next release
 * 
 *  SO ONE THING THESE THREE TOPICS WE ARE GOING TO COVER LOGGING , ALERTING , FIXING THIS ENTIRE MODULE IS THORITICAL BUT MUST
 *  BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN GOOD AMOUNT OF NEW THINGS.

 *        
 *    This is great interview question like suppose user facing issue in production then how will you 
 *    fix it ?
 * 
 *    Normal Ans : I will ask my support team to contact with user and then i will be on call with
 *    user see the issue in network tab and once i understand i will do the hot fix
 *    (THIS WAS THE REAL PROCESS ONE OF THE ED TECH COMPANY I WORKED FOR)
 * 
 *    PRO-ANSWER : IN OUR APLLICATION WE ALSO EACH LOGGING AND MONITORING WHERE WE LOGS WHAT KIND
 *    OF ISSUES USER ARE FACHING AND EACH AND EVERY DEVICE INFO WHICH HELP US TO FIX ISSUES WITHOUT
 *    EVEN CONNECTING WITH USERS.
 * 
 *    THINK ABOUT MULTI LOGGING ISSUES CAN WE FIXED WITH LOGGING AND ALERTING LIKE THIS COURSE IS
 *    ACCESS FROM 5 DIFFERENT MEANS SOMETHING PHISHE IS GOING ON IN THAT CASE WE CAN BLOCK THE 
 *    ACCOUNT
 * 
 *    RIGHT SET OF LOGGING DATA CAN REALLY HELP US TO FIX ISSUES IN SPEED
 * 
 *    ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PII DATA OF USER ELSE YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY BIG FINE
 * 
 *    WHAT IF ERROR HAPPENS BEFORE EVEN YOUR LOGGING GET INTIATE THIS IS GOOD QUESTION
 * 
 *    TALKING ABOUT ABOVE THING SOME CAN HAVE GOOD IMPRETION IN INTERVIEWS
 * 
 *    ALWAYS ALWAYS THING ABOUT PII DON'T STORE HELL OUT OF USER DATA
 * 
 *    SO FROM INTRO WE LEARNED ABOUT LOGGING MONITORING ALERTING FIXING
 * 
 *    DARK AND LIGHT THEAM IS KIND OF FEATURE IS NOT WORKING ITS FINE IF YOU DON'T HAVE
 *    LOGGING
 * 
 *    IN SHORT IF ANY GOOD TO HAVE FEATURE DOES NOT HAVE LOGGING THEN ITS YOU DON'T NEED LOGGING
 *    FOR THOSE
