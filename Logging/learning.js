/**
 *   In this module we don't have any practical's to cover but this module will cover about different logging tools why those are
 *   importent and how do you test application when it's in production
 * 
 *   Why user logs matters and when you are logging details how importent it is to care about different GDPA , HIPPA and PIA all this
 *   guidline's regarding user information
 * 
 *   Tools that we are going to cover
 * 
 *    Google Analytics
 *    Microsoft Clearity (This is lit)
 *    LogRocket
 *    Syntry 
 *    Open Telemetry
 *    
 * 
 *  Now above all tools will give you information about user events and we can add our custom events also
 * 
 *  But after Logging next importent step would be Alearting which helps us when something critical happens
 *  or something passed some threshold this is lit and even in tools like Syntry offers us the 
 *  alerting system our SMS , EMAIL SLACK AND ONCALL ALSO . ONCALL IS LIT
 * 
 *  Next after alerting and logging last step is fixing see its always upto criticality of bug like how seviour it
 *  is in my career i have done lot's of hot fixes also and 80% case we just log the bug in JIRA and then 
 *  set  version for next release
 * 
 *  SO ONE THING THESE THREE TOPICS WE ARE GOING TO COVER LOGGING , ALERTING , FIXING THIS ENTIRE MODULE IS THORITICAL BUT MUST
 *  BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN GOOD AMOUNT OF NEW THINGS.
